abstract={Aims: Through the nutrient fertilization experiment, we aimed to understand how litter decomposition and nutrient release response to the elevated soil N and P availability. Methods: A factorial fertilization experiment was conducted in a tropical forest in South China. Leaf litters of five species (Acacia auriculaeformis, Syzygium levinei, Carallia brachiate, Schefflera octophylla, Aphanamixis polystachya) and their mixed sample were put into litter bags in plots fertilized with N, P, or N and P together and collected every three months during the 18-months decomposition. Mass loss of leaf litters and nutrients content were measured. Results: N addition decreased decomposition rates by 15–40%, and the magnitude was species-specific, while P addition had no significant influence on the litter decomposition of all species. Decomposition rate of leaf litter were lower in species with higher C/P ratios and cellulose content. All types of litters served as a net N source during the decomposition. The amounts of mineral elements released during the decomposition followed the order: K > Mg > Ca, and N addition accelerated the Ca and Mg release from litters. Conclusions: The result suggests that future high N deposition can reduce the tropical forest litter decomposition rate but enhance the mineral nutrients release, which may contribute to higher soil C sequestration, while soil P availability does not influence the litter decomposition. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The present study aimed to evaluate fine aboveground litterfall, deposition of nitrogen and phosphorus from total litterfall and leaf litter decomposition in areas of tall forest (Mata Alta) and low forest on sandy soils (Mussununga) in southeastern Brazil. Fine litterfall was collected monthly for two years (from June/2007 to May/2009) in 10 conical collectors (0.25 m2) in each phytophysiognomy (1 ha plots). The material was subsequently separated into leaves, branches, flowers and fruits, and unidentified material. Leaf decomposition rates were evaluated using 15 litterbags, three of which were collected every 30 days. Higher litterfall occurred in both phytophysiognomies during the rainy season, with leaves predominating. The lowest litterfall, nutrient input, and leaf litter decomposition values appeared to be nutrient conservation strategies, contributing to the ecological functioning of the Mussununga where soil fertility was lower than in the Mata Alta. © 2020 Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ).},

abstract={Nitrogen (N) plays a vital role in litter decomposition by interacting with microbial activity in temperate and boreal ecosystems. However, in tropical and subtropical forests, where low soil phosphorus (P) availability is widespread, how P affects litter decomposition remains unclear. In the present study, litter-bag method was used to conduct fine root decomposition by P addition experiment in a subtropical natural evergreen broad-leaved forest. Fine roots were collected from two tree species: Cunninghamia lanceolata and Castanopsis carlesii, and their mixture in equal proportion as well. At the end of 2-year experiment, we found an enhancement of soil total P, available P, pH and microbial biomass carbon content, and increased abundance of all the examined microbial groups and total PLFA biomass after P addition. Annual decomposition constants of fine roots of both tree species and the mixture (0.615–1.049) were all elevated, but to different extents by P addition, with fine roots of lower initial P concentration corresponding to higher increase in decomposition rate. Average acid phosphatase activities during decomposition were significantly decreased, but there was a general increase for β-glucosidase (βG), cellobiohydrolase (CBH), phenol oxidase, peroxidase (PerOx) and N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG) activities. The response ratios of enzyme activities, which differed for the three experimental fine roots, corresponded to the individual increase in decomposition rates. Correlation analysis demonstrated that fine root decomposition rates were significantly related to initial P concentration, extractives and acid-insoluble fractions of fine roots, and activities of βG, CBH, NAG and PerOx as well. Taken together, our results demonstrate that fine root decomposition can be constrained by P availability through affecting microbial activity in this subtropical natural forest. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Forest litter inputs to soil can stimulate the decomposition of older soil organic matter (SOM) via a priming effect (PE). The magnitude and underlying mechanisms driving PE are poorly understood, with especially little know about how litter quality and site conditions affect PE in situ. Further, very few studies have examined PE in tropical and subtropical soils. Here, we established low and high elevation sites (600 vs. 1,400 m a.s.l.) in the subtropical Wuyishan National Park, China, that differed with respect to mean annual temperature (MAT; ∆MAT = 4.2°C), vegetation, soil texture and soil moisture. We conducted a 1-year field incubation study at these two sites to compare PE induced by adding low- and high-quality 13C-labelled leaf litter to soils. At the low elevation site, additions of high-quality (low C/N) litter caused a PE that was 140% greater than the PE observed following additions of low-quality (high C/N) litter. In contrast, we saw no significant differences in PE between litter types at the high elevation site, perhaps because PE was not limited by substrate quality at this cooler, finer textured and higher soil moisture coniferous site. In addition, we found a negative relationship between home-field advantage (HFA) for litter decomposition and PE, indicating that specialized litter decomposer community driving HFA may not accelerate SOM decomposition via PE in the same way. In line with our observed strong relationship between PE and the efficiency of priming (PE size per unit of mineralized litter C), PEs induced by the high- and low-quality litters were directed to microbial phosphorus (P) mining rather than nitrogen (N) mining. This interpretation aligns with observed increases in the activity of P acquiring extracellular enzymes, often described as phosphatases (P-tases), as well as the positive relationship between the PE, P-tase activity and the activity of C acquiring extracellular enzymes. Overall, this PE study across two contrasting sites highlights the important role of site characteristics and litter quality in regulating PE size. Further, we suggest that MAT may be a dominant driver of soil priming, through both the direct effects of litter quantity on labile substrate supply and the indirect effects of litter quality changes on downstream decomposer communities.

abstract={Iron (Fe) is one of the most abundant elements in the earth's crust and intensively interferes with the biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C) and phosphorous (P), especially in highly weathered tropical and subtropical soils. The strong affinity of phosphate to Fe oxides and hydroxides limits the P availability in paddy soils. Reductive dissolution of Fe(III) can release occluded and adsorbed P into solution and make it available for plant uptake. Such effects remain elusive, especially in highly weathered subtropical paddy soils with oscillating redox (Eh) conditions. Under submerged conditions, incomplete litter decomposition occurs and rice roots release large amounts of labile organic compounds as exudates. We investigated the role of acetate, formate, oxalate, and propionate on Fe(III) reduction, P mobilization, and CO2 efflux in two paddy soils (i.e. oxisol and ultisol) of varying organic C (OC) and Fe(II) contents. Microbial mineralization of added labile C decreased soil Eh and increased the rates of Fe(III) reduction followed by P mobilization. This indicated that microbially-mediated Fe(III) reduction was intensified by labile OC compounds, which acted as energy sources and electron donors. The release of available P via Fe reduction was accompanied by peaks in Fe(II), dissolved OC, and pH and was followed by a decrease in iron-bound P (Fe–P). This implied that Fe–P was the main source of available P in the paddy soils. The faster release of available P in the oxisol than the ultisol indicated that the higher OC and Fe(II) contents in the oxisol allowed a fast Eh decrease, leading to rapid microbial oxygen (O2) consumption and consequently faster and more intensive Fe(III) to Fe(II) reduction. This conclusion is supported by a faster Eh decrease in the oxisol than the ultisol corresponding to early P mobilization after input of labile C, and it suggests that Eh-driven Fe transformations and P mobilization are strongly modulated by labile OC mineralization. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Aims: Lignin has long been considered a recalcitrant component of plant materials. Its degradation is critical for litter decomposition and the formation of soil organic matter. However, little is known about lignin degradation dynamics and its controlling factors during leaf litter decomposition, especially in forest ecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate lignin degradation dynamics during litter decomposition and its controlling factors. Methods: We conducted a lab incubation experiment for 180 days with leaves of two tree species (Fagus lucida and Schima parviflora) from a mid-subtropical forest in China. The CuO oxidation method was applied for lignin determination. The mass loss of bulk litter and lignin (including V-, S- and C-type phenols) and the dynamics of litter microbial community composition, carbon, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were determined during the incubation. Results: Lignin degradation appeared to be a two-phase process over the incubation period, including a fast decomposition phase (early stage) followed by a relatively slow decomposition phase (late stage). Additionally, 21.9% and 18.5% of the initial lignin contents were lost from F. lucida and S. parviflora litter, respectively. The acid to aldehyde ratios of V-type phenols [(Ac/Al)V] and S-type phenols [(Ac/Al)S] of both litters increased with incubation. Lignin degradation was significantly affected by the litter types but not by the soil microbial communities, given that the soil microbial communities were distinctly different for the two plant communities. In the early stage, the mass loss of lignin from the F. lucida litter was faster than the S. parviflora litter: the mass loss of S-type phenols from the F. lucida litter was faster than the S. parviflora litter, whereas the dynamics of the V-type phenols were comparable for the two species. For F. lucida litter, lignin was lost faster than the bulk litter in the early stage but no difference was observed after day 133. For S. parviflora litter, the degradation of lignin and bulk litter were generally comparable over the incubation period. The mass loss of lignin in the early stage was significantly correlated with lignin, N and P contents, and the carbon/N, carbon/P and N/P ratios. Among these factors, P played a prominent role in controlling lignin degradation. Conclusions: The important role of litter chemistry emphasized the importance of taking this into account in plant-soil models assessing carbon dynamics in forest ecosystems. These results improve our conceptual understanding of lignin degradation and its controlling factors. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The potential of excessive nitrogen (N)suppressing litter decay in is widely recognized. The role of phosphorus (P)in plant litter decay is less understood and is generally assumed to have a weak influence in decomposition outside tropical or wetland ecosystems. Based on the “microbial mining” hypothesis that suggests the availability of limiting nutrients is the driving mechanism of decay, P could have a strong influence on carbon (C)cycling in low-P ecosystems. The objective of this study was to determine if increasing P availability will influence the decomposition of leaf litter in a low-P temperate forested ecosystem. If the availability of a limiting nutrient is a driving mechanism mediating decay, then increasing the availability of P in a low-P environment should inhibit decay. The experiment was held in a low-P mixed mesophytic forest in the unglaciated Alleghany Plateau (USA). Since 2009, P availability has been increased either directly by phosphate fertilizer and/or indirectly by raising soil pH. Starting in 2012 and for three consecutive years, Quercus spp. leaf litter bags were deployed and harvested at least every year for three years for temporal replication. After three years, elevating pH and/or P litter mass loss was ∼52% and significantly (P &lt; 0.001)lower than the control at 73% mass loss. The mean residence time (MRT; k yr−1)for the control was 2.1 years, but elevating P with pH increased MRT to 5.3 years. Results support the “microbial phosphorus mining” hypothesis that P has the potential to inhibit decay for Quercus spp. leaf litter in temperate forests and potentially increase soil C. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Whereas the primary controls on litter decomposition are well established, we lack a framework for predicting interspecific differences in litter decay within and across ecosystems. Given previous research linking tree mycorrhizal association with carbon and nutrient dynamics, we hypothesized that the two dominant mycorrhizal groups in forests – arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi – differ in litter decomposition rates. We compiled leaf litter chemistry and decay data for AM- and ECM-associating angiosperms and gymnosperms (> 200 species) from temperate and tropical/subtropical, and investigated relationships among decay rates, mycorrhizal association, phylogeny and climate. In temperate forests, AM litters decayed faster than ECM litters, with litter nitrogen and phylogeny best explaining variation in litter decay. In sub/tropical forests, we found no significant difference in litter decay rate between mycorrhizal groups, and variation in decay rates was best explained by litter phosphorus. Our results suggest that knowledge of tree mycorrhizal association may improve predictions of species effects on ecosystem processes, particularly in temperate forests where AM and ECM species commonly co-occur, providing a predictive framework for linking litter quality, organic matter dynamics and nutrient acquisition in forests. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Background and aim: Litter decomposition is of great concern as it plays a key role in regulating global carbon cycle and nutrient budgets, especially in tropical forests where it is very fast. Therefore, we studied the decomposition and subsequent changes in element concentrations and amounts of 11 tropical leaf litter. Methods: Fresh litters were characterized in terms of elemental, proximate features, as well as organic carbon compositions by 13 C-NMR spectroscopy. Controlled litterbag decomposition was carried out for 180 days in the laboratory, bags were retrieved at three dates and analyzed for mass loss and concentration of nitrogen (N), potassium (K), sodium (Na), carbon (C), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), phosphorus (P), zinc (Zn), and percentage of ash, extractives, cellulose and lignin. Results: Terminalia arjuna showed highest mass loss, while the lowest was observed in Shorea robusta showing significant positive correlation with litter initial K, Mg, Fe and di-O-alkyl C, O-alkyl C, while significant negative correlation with Mn, lignin and Methoxyl C, Alkyl C. Trajectories shows that Fe, Mg, K, Mn, Zn and Na concentrations increased in most of the litter types, except Terminalia arjuna and Toona ciliata, where Fe, Mg, K concentrations decreased during decomposition. Surprisingly, in most of the species with the exception of Terminalia arjuna, N concentrations decreased at a faster rate than C concentrations, resulting in an increase in C/N ratios. Expectedly, lignin progressively increased, while cellulose decreased. Conclusions: Observed differences in decomposition rate and dynamics of chemical changes among litters were strongly affected by the litter type, decomposition time and their interactions. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Seasonal changes in rainfall might have an impact on the decomposition of mangrove leaf litter. This study analyzed the influence of weather conditions (season) on the decay rate, nitrogen, and phosphorus content as a decomposition indicator of leaf litter of Rhizophora racemosa. These measurements were taken at two sites in the Térraba-Sierpe National Wetland (TSNW) South Pacific, Coasta Rica, in 2013. The dry and wet season decay constants were similar and fast (k = 0.012 day -1 ). Decay constants were positively associated with salinity and water temperature (p &lt;0.10). Moreover, season had an effect on the leaf litter nitrogen (high in dry season) and phosphorus content (high in rainy season). The effect of decomposition time on nitrogen and phosphorus content varies between sites. Leaf litter from R. racemosa acts as a substrate that releases nutrients to the ecosystem, contributing to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus budgets. The similar and fast decay constants among seasons is possibly because of the small difference in seasonal rainfall in TSNW, while seasonal variation in nitrogen and phosphorus is possibly a result of changes in microbial activity. This study highlights the need for an integral approach to research on nutrient cycling in mangrove forests because of its complex decay patterns. © 2019 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={Seagrass ecosystems are vital for its regulatory services yet, highly threatened by degradation due to human pressures. Decomposition of two tropical seagrass species (Cymodocea serrulata and Cymodocea rotundata) was studied and compared, to understand their potential in generating additional nutrients to coastal waters. Release of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus during the decomposition process of seagrass wracks was estimated in bacteria-active (non-poisoned) and bacteria-inhibited (poisoned) conditions from shore-washed fresh seagrass, sampled from Palk Bay, India. Incubation experiments for 25 days indicated a near three times higher concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in bacteria-inhibited flasks compared to bacteria-active conditions for both species. The maximum leaching rates of DOC, TDN and TDP were found to be 294, 65.1 and 11.2 μM/g dry wt/day, respectively. Further, higher release of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) (&gt; 1.3 times) was documented from the bacteria-active flask, highlighting the significance of microbial process in generating bio-available nutrients from decaying seagrass. Faster decomposition (0.014 ± 0.004 day −1 ) in the initial stages (up to 8 days) compared to the later stages (0.005 ± 0.001 day −1 ) indicated a rapid loss of biomass carbon during the initial leaching process and its relative importance in the decomposition pathway. The decomposition rate is best described by a single-stage exponential decay model with a half-life of 41 days. It is estimated that the total seagrass litter available along the Palk Bay coast is about ~ 0.3 Gg with high potential of additional nitrogen (0.9 ± 0.5 Mg) and phosphorus (0.3 ± 0.1 Mg) supply to the adjacent coastal waters. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Aims Soil microorganisms in forest ecosystems play vital roles in regulating above-and belowground ecosystem processes and functions such as soil nutrient cycling, litter decomposition, net ecosystem productivity, and ecosystem succession. We aim to investigate broad-scale seasonal patterns of soil microbial biomass carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry. Methods By synthesizing 164 samples of soil microbial biomass C, N and P content derived from the published literature, we investigated global seasonal patterns of soil microbial C, N, P content and their ratios across three vegetation types of global forests. Important findings Soil microbial biomass C, N and P content in temperate and subtropical forests were lower in summer and higher in winter. Soil microbial biomass C, N and P content in tropical forests were lower than those in temperate and subtropical forests in four seasons. Soil microbial biomass C and N content in tropical forests were relatively the lowest in autumn, and soil microbial biomass P content was relatively constant in all seasons. The soil microbial biomass C:N of temperate forest was significantly higher than that of other two forest types in spring, and that of tropical forest was significantly higher than that of other two forest types in autumn. Soil microbial biomass N:P and C:P in temperate forests remained relatively constant in four seasons, while those in tropical forests were higher than those in other three seasons in summer. The soil microbial biomass C content, N content, N:P and C:P of broad-leaved trees were significantly higher than those of conifers in four seasons, while the soil microbial biomass P content of conifers was significantly higher than that of broad-leaved trees in four seasons. There was no significant difference in soil microbial biomass C:N between broad-leaved and coniferous trees in both spring and winter, but the soil microbial biomass C:N of coniferous trees was significantly higher than that of broad-leaved trees in summer and autumn. For the change of soil microbial biomass, season is not but forest type is the main significant factor, suggesting that the seasonal fluctuation of soil microbial biomass changes with the inherent periodic change of trees. Asynchronous nutrient uptake by plants and soil microorganisms is a trade-off mechanism between nutrient retention and ecological function maintenance. © 2019 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology.

abstract={Simultaneous measurement of plant functional traits and the regeneration environment should shed light on the plant-environment interactions and feedbacks as secondary forest regenerates. However, little of such work has been done in the wet tropics, and even fewer studies have examined soil nutrients. We investigated whether plant functional traits and environmental variables explain the varied recovery of secondary forests in Singapore. Our study plots included three primary forest plots and eight approximately 60-year-old secondary forest plots regenerating from intensive agricultural activities. Using 35 seedling quadrats, we asked: Q1) How do environmental variables explain the variation in seedling functional traits observed in primary and secondary forests? Q2) How do seedling traits, adult traits and environmental variables relate and explain variation in species richness and stem density in secondary forests? We found that both light and soil fertility explained the shifts in plants functional traits from poorly recovering secondary forests to primary forests. Poor forest regrowth was correlated with high soil aluminum levels and lower leaf nitrogen concentrations. Low nutrients and high aluminum saturation were also negatively correlated with seedling species richness, but not stem density, in the secondary forests. Forest recovery is probably slowed by positive feedback between slower nutrient returns from slow decaying litter and further recruitment of nutrient conserving species, as indicated by positive correlations among adult leaf CN ratio, litter depth, soil CN ratio and quadrat level CN ratio. Plant functional traits are indicative of the strategies of successful seedlings and do not necessarily relate to overall forest recovery. Hence, while some specialist plant species are able to accrue high nutrients on degraded soils with aluminum toxicity and low nutrients, species richness on these soils was poor. This underscores the need to concurrently measure environmental variables and plant traits when investigating the mechanisms driving changes during forest recovery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Hurricanes Jova and Patricia were the first hurricanes in recent history to make landfall on the tropical dry forest ecosystem of the Pacific coast of Mexico. We examined the resilience of soil N and P availability and organic matter decomposition to the effects of both hurricanes in pastures, successional fields and old-growth forests of this region. We evaluated resistance by comparing measurements made before and after each hurricane. We also examined temporal trends to test if variables non-resistant to Jova recovered during the four-year period between both hurricanes. We considered resilient those variables that either showed resistance or were not resistant but showed recovery. We hypothesized that decomposition and soil nutrient availability would increase shortly due to the massive incorporation of high-quality decomposing materials after both hurricanes, especially under land covers with more woody vegetation, and return to pre-hurricane values within a couple of years. Our tests showed that most variables measured were not resistant to either hurricane and that the direction or magnitude of change sometimes differed between hurricanes. There was a fourfold increase in soil available N after hurricane Jova and a twofold increase after hurricane Patricia. Soil available P changed little over the entire period. Total litter stocks resisted hurricane passage and differed only among land covers whereas litter C, N and P stocks changed with the hurricane and became more similar in all land covers over the following three years. The soil N peak caused a decrease in the C:N and N:P ratios in the litter produced from the leaf flush some months after Hurricane Jova. This decrease was measured, however, only two years after hurricane Jova in total accumulated litter. Decomposition rates of local recent litter decreased after hurricane Jova and increased after hurricane Patricia but recovered within two years after hurricane Jova. Decomposition of a standard material in all sites, used as a control, showed a decreasing trend suggesting a continuous reduction in decomposer activity after hurricane Jova. Overall there were smaller differences among land covers than we had expected and their inter-annual fluctuations in most variables were surprisingly similar. We conclude that nutrient availability and decomposition were in general not resistant but returned to pre-hurricane levels within the four years between hurricane Jova and hurricane Patricia. Therefore, these ecosystem functions seemed resilient, at least to hurricane Jova. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Low-order streams of Upper Guinea receive substantial leaf litter inputs and are characterized by intermittent flow. The ecosystem functioning of such streams flowing in savannah, a common tropical vegetation and the dominant biome in West Africa, remains largely overlooked. We hypothesized litter decomposition in such streams to be (1) fast due to the expectedly high nutrient content of tropical litter, and (2) mostly driven by microorganisms due to the widely revealed paucity of tropical macroinvertebrate consumers, and even exacerbated in these systems by water temporariness. Decomposition rates of 2 common riparian tree species, Alchornea cordifolia and Pterocarpus santalinoides, in 2 streams ranged from 0.0287 to 0.0649 d−1. The process was clearly governed by microbial decomposers, as shown by the exceptionally low mass loss discrepancy between fine and coarse mesh bags, a lack of shredders, and high leaf-associated fungal biomass (measured as ergosterol: up to 0.92 and 0.37 mg g−1 litter of ash-free dry mass for Alchornea and Pterocarpus, respectively), together with moderate conidial production rate. In such savannah streams, the absence of leaf-shredding invertebrates seems to be compensated by a high microbial activity, providing an ultimate case for the reported preponderance of microbial decomposers over invertebrate decomposers at low latitudes. In contrast with temperate temporary streams, the processing of leaf litter from riparian trees, characterized by high nitrogen and phosphorus content, is sufficiently fast to be unaffected by flow intermittency. © 2018, © 2018 International Society of Limnology (SIL).},

abstract={Rapid and extensive conversion of tropical forests into oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) (OP) plantations pose serious threats to tropical stream processes. To mitigate land use change impacts on stream ecosystems, retention of riparian vegetation is typically proposed. We evaluated the effectiveness of a gradient of riparian qualities in oil palm streams: (1) natural forest; (2) OP-native forested buffer; (3) OP-native understory, no chemical input (OPOP) and (4) OP-no buffer, to mitigate impacts on in-stream litter processing. Leaf bag method entry using two leaf species of contrasting litter quality (Macaranga tanarius and OP) were deployed into streams. Across all riparian types, microbes were the main drivers of decomposition with negligible macroinvertebrate shredding activities. Leaf decomposition rates were more influenced by litter quality than changes in environmental conditions in the different riparian types. Across all sites, native Macaranga litter decomposed approximately 5× faster than OP litter possibly due to high structural compounds in OP leaves. Macaranga litter was also more susceptible to changes in environmental conditions as leaf decomposition positively correlated to phosphorus and potassium content. However, OP leaves were resilient to stream environmental changes and decomposed slower only at OPOP sites. These varying responses reveal complex interactions within tropical stream ecosystems. We suggest that riparian management strategies as well as plans to restore functioning in degraded tropical streams should ensure a wide diversity of native riparian tree species in order to effectively mitigate adverse OP plantation impacts on tropical stream functioning. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Litter decomposition is an important control on carbon accumulation in tropical peatlands. Stoichiometric theory suggests that decomposition is regulated by elemental ratios in litter while the home field advantage (HFA) hypothesis predicts that decomposer communities are adapted to local conditions. To date, the relative importance of these contrasting theories for litter decomposition and therefore the carbon balance of tropical peatlands remain poorly understood. We conducted two in situ litter decomposition experiments in a lowland tropical peatland. The first experiment tested the importance of the stoichiometric theory using a factorial nutrient addition experiment at two sites with contrasting vegetation (Raphia taedigera and Campnosperma panamensis) to assess how nutrient addition affected microbial enzyme activity and litter mass loss at the peat surface and at 50 cm depth. The second experiment tested the importance of HFA by reciprocal translocation of leaf litter from R. taedigera and C. panamensis forests, which differed in both litter chemistry and soil nutrient availability, to separate the influence of litter chemistry and soil/site properties on litter mass loss. The activities of hydrolytic enzymes involved in the decomposition of large plant polymers were stimulated by nitrogen addition only where nitrogen availability was low relative to phosphorus, and were stimulated by phosphorus addition where phosphorus availability was low. The addition of nitrogen, but not phosphorus, increased leaf litter decomposition under waterlogged conditions at 50 cm depth, but not at the peat surface. Decomposition was greatest for autochthonous litter irrespective of site nutrient status, indicating that adaptation of the microbial community to low nutrients can partly overcome nutrient limitation, and suggesting that HFA can influence litter decomposition rates. Synthesis. Our study shows that leaf litter decomposition and the activity of microbial enzymes in tropical peatlands are constrained in part by nutrient availability. However, such nutrient limitation of litter decomposition can be overcome by adaptation of the microbial community. © 2017 The Authors. Journal of Ecology © 2017 British Ecological Society},

abstract={Aim: Trees associating with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi typically occur in infertile soils and use nutrients more conservatively than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees. We hypothesized that ECM trees would have greater nutrient resorption (i.e., proportion of nutrients resorbed during leaf senescence) than AM trees. Location: Global. Methods: We synthesized nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) resorption data from 378 species from sub/tropical, temperate and boreal forests, including 43 studies where ECM and AM trees co-occurred, and conducted a meta-analysis. Additionally, we quantified N resorption in 45 plots varying in ECM-AM tree abundances in the temperate deciduous forests of southern Indiana, USA. Results: Overall, resorption patterns were driven primarily by mycorrhizal type, climate zone, and to a lesser degree, leaf habit. In the boreal forest, P resorption was 76% greater for ECM than AM trees (p &lt;.05). In the sub/tropics, AM trees resorbed 30% more N than ECM trees. At the sites where AM and ECM trees co-occurred, ECM trees resorbed more N in temperate forests (15% greater; p &lt;.001) whereas AM trees tended to resorb more N in sub/tropical forests (by 29%; p =.08). Besides, deciduous ECM trees resorbed more N (10%) and P (15%) than deciduous AM trees, while evergreen ECM and AM trees did not differ. In the deciduous forests of Indiana, where ECM and AM trees co-occurred, the relative abundance of ECM trees in a plot was positively correlated to plot-scale N resorption (R2 =.25, p =.001), indicating greater nutrient conservatism with increasing ECM-dominance. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that mycorrhizal association – in addition to other factors – is correlated with the degree to which trees recycle nutrients, with the strongest effects occurring for N resorption by temperate deciduous trees. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Tropical forests play an important role in global carbon (C) cycling due to high primary productivity and rapid litter and soil organic C decomposition. However, it is still unclear how changing rainfall will influence soil CO2 losses (i.e. via soil respiration) in tropical forests. Here, using a rainfall and litter manipulation experiment in a tropical forest, we show that enhanced litter-leached dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production with increased rainfall frequency drives substantial CO2 loss via soil respiration. A 50% increase in rainfall frequency (no change in total rainfall amount) enhanced inputs of DOC by 28%, total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) by 17%, and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) by 34% through leaching from litter layer to soil surface likely due to faster litter decomposition rate, and stimulated soil respiration by ∼17% (about 1.16 t C ha−1 yr−1). Soil respiration responded to altered rainfall frequency with limited when litter layer was removed. Accordingly, soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and fine root biomass were increased by 23% and 20%, respectively only in the plots with litter layer. A 50% reduction in total rainfall (no change in rainfall frequency) did not change litter-leached DOC and nutrients fluxes, soil MBC, fine root biomass, or annual mean soil respiration rates. The new finding – that enhanced leached-DOC production with increased rainfall frequency drives profound increases in soil respiration in tropical forests – suggests that future climate changes may have significant impacts on soil C dynamics and global C budget, and argues for the importance of incorporating this underappreciated feedback into prognostic models used to predict future C-climate interactions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Elevated anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition is suggested to affect ecosystem phosphorus (P) cycling through altered biotic P demand and soil acidification. To date, however, there has been little information on how long-term N deposition regulates P fluxes in tropical forests, where P is often depleted. To address this question, we conducted a long-term N addition experiment in a mature tropical forest in southern China, using the following N treatments: 0, 50, 100, and 150 kg N ha−1 year−1. We hypothesized that (i) tropical forest ecosystems have conservative P cycling with low P output, and (ii) long-term N addition decreases total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) leaching losses due to reduced litter decomposition rates and stimulated P sorption deriving from accelerated soil acidification. As hypothesized, we demonstrated a closed P cycling with low leaching outputs in our forest. Under experimental N addition, TDP flux in throughfall was significantly reduced, suggesting that N addition may result in a less internal P recycling. Contrary to our hypothesis, N addition did not decrease TDP leaching, despite reduced litter decomposition and accelerated soil acidification. We find that N addition might have negative impacts on biological P uptake without affecting TDP leaching, and that the amount of TDP leaching from soil could be lower than a minimum concentration for TDP retention. Overall, we conclude that long-term N deposition does not necessarily decrease P effluxes from tropical forest ecosystems with conservative P cycling. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

funding_text 1={Holzmann et al. 2016). Also, an earlier study at our site showed that N addition reduced fine root biomass (Lu et al. 2010). Therefore, we suggest that P uptake though plant roots could be greatly suppressed, which may lead to P shortage to plants. Accordingly, the reduced P leaching from leaves may maintain foliar nutrient balance, which was supported by no changes in foliar P concentrations under N treatments (Fig. 5, personal communication with Mianhai Zheng). However, further observation such as fractions of foliar and soil P will be necessary to fully understand the mechanisms leading to reduced P concentrations in throughfall with elevated N addition.},

abstract={Leaf litter decomposition is a critical step in nutrient cycling and providing nutrients to plants. Decomposition of dry matter, lignin, ligno-cellulose, cellulose and polyphenols was investigated in relation to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) dynamics in leaf litter of mango, guava and litchi orchards under hot and dry sub-humid climate. Leaf litter of mango and guava decomposed more rapidly than that of litchi with decay constants of 3.22, 1.33 and 0.62 yr-1, respectively. The leaf litter organic substances like polyphenol lost more rapidly followed by cellulose, lignin and ligno-cellulose throughout the period of decomposition. The N was released faster both in mango and guava with decay constant of 4.06 and 2.11 yr-1, respectively. The release of K was faster in mango followed by guava and litchi with decay constant of 4.66, 3.18 and 1.63 yr-1, respectively. The leaf litter decomposition was significantly positively correlated with soil fungal and bacterial biomass, rainfall and air temperature, while the leaf chemistry showed significant negative correlations in all the orchards. The results demonstrated that mango leaf litter was found to be the best followed by guava, and litchi in terms of N, P, and K return in less period of time. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={In hyperdiverse tropical forests, the key drivers of litter decomposition are poorly understood despite its crucial role in facilitating nutrient availability for plants and microbes. Selective logging is a pressing land use with potential for considerable impacts on plant–soil interactions, litter decomposition, and nutrient cycling. Here, in Borneo's tropical rainforests, we test the hypothesis that decomposition is driven by litter quality and that there is a significant “home-field advantage,” that is positive interaction between local litter quality and land use. We determined mass loss of leaf litter, collected from selectively logged and old-growth forest, in a fully factorial experimental design, using meshes that either allowed or precluded access by mesofauna. We measured leaf litter chemical composition before and after the experiment. Key soil chemical and biological properties and microclimatic conditions were measured as land-use descriptors. We found that despite substantial differences in litter quality, the main driver of decomposition was land-use type. Whilst inclusion of mesofauna accelerated decomposition, their effect was independent of land use and litter quality. Decomposition of all litters was slower in selectively logged forest than in old-growth forest. However, there was significantly greater loss of nutrients from litter, especially phosphorus, in selectively logged forest. The analyses of several covariates detected minor microclimatic differences between land-use types but no alterations in soil chemical properties or free-living microbial composition. These results demonstrate that selective logging can significantly reduce litter decomposition in tropical rainforest with no evidence of a home-field advantage. We show that loss of key limiting nutrients from litter (P & N) is greater in selectively logged forest. Overall, the findings hint at subtle differences in microclimate overriding litter quality that result in reduced decomposition rates in selectively logged forests and potentially affect biogeochemical nutrient cycling in the long term. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Human activities affect both tree species composition and diversity in forested ecosystems. This in turn alters the species diversity of plant litter and litter quality, which may have cascading effects on soil microbial communities and their functions for decomposition and nutrient cycling. We tested microbial responses to litter species diversity in a leaf litter decomposition experiment including monocultures, 2-, and 4-species mixtures in the subtropical climate zone of southeastern China. Soil microbial community composition was assessed by lipid analysis, and microbial functions were measured using extracellular enzyme activity and gross rates of nitrogen mineralization. We observed a positive relationship between litter species diversity and abundances of mycorrhizal fungi and actinomycetes. Alternatively, enzyme activities involved in carbon and phosphorus acquisition, and enzyme indices of relative carbon limitation, were higher only in the 4-species mixtures. This suggests that the minimum basal substrate level for enzyme production was reached, or that limitation was higher, at the highest diversity level only. Responses to litter diversity also changed over time, where phosphatase responses to litter diversity were strongest early in decomposition and the indices of carbon limitation relative to other nutrients showed stronger responses later in decomposition. Enzyme activities were related to lipid biomarker data and the mass of litter remaining at the third time point, but relationships between enzyme activity and the mass of litter remaining were not consistent across other time points. We conclude that litter species richness will likely only reduce microbial functions at key intervals of diversity loss while microbial growth is more sensitive to incremental diversity loss, with no clear relationships between them or to ecosystem functions. The observed litter diversity effects on soil microbial biomass and enzyme activity indicate interactions of aboveground and belowground communities, and together with environmental conditions they are important for maintaining ecosystem functions. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Tropical and subtropical dry forest life zones support forests with lower stature and species richness than do tropical and subtropical life zones with greater water availability. The number of naturalized species that can thrive and mix with native species to form novel forests in dry forest conditions in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands is lower than in other insular life zones. These novel dry forests are young (<60 years) with low structural development, high species dominance, and variable species density. Species density is low during initial establishment and increases with age. At the 1-ha scale, novel forests can have greater species density than mature native forests. Species groups, such as nitrogen-fixing species, and other naturalized species that dominate novel dry forests, have a disproportional influence on forest element stoichiometry. Novel dry forests, compared to the mean of all forest species assemblages island-wide, tend to have fallen leaf litter with lower than average manganese and sodium concentrations and lower than average C/N and C/P ratios. After accounting for significant differences in stand age, geology, and or precipitation, novel dry forests compared to native dry forests have higher C anomalies, lower Ca and Na anomalies, and lower C/N ratio anomalies. Taken together, these characteristics may influence litter decomposition rates and the species composition, diversity, and food web dynamics in litter and soil. Novel dry forests also contribute to the conservation of native plant species on highly degraded lands. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={While soils can act either as a source or as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and nitrogen, depending on land cover change and management, there is a great need to improve our understanding of the dynamics of soil structure and chemistry following land conversion in tropical regions. In this study, we investigated various soil structural and chemical variables (bulk density, pH, cation exchange capacity, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium), soil carbon (C), soil nitrogen (N), δ13C, and δ15N in relation to conversion of rain forest to tea cultivation and subsequent changes due to agricultural abandonment and reforestation with Caribbean pine. Although Caribbean pine has shown potential for reforestation throughout Asia and Latin America, effects on soil properties in comparison with other land uses have not been quantified. Our study compared: (1) the original mixed-dipterocarp rain forest, (2) tea plantations, (3) Kekilla fernlands and (4) Caribbean pine plantations. Tea plantations show higher bulk density (BD) as an evidence of compaction. Although soil C concentration in tea plantations were lower than other land uses at 0–10 cm, when bulk density was used with C as a composite measure, tea plantation showed the highest value for both soil C and N stocks. Disregarding tea plantations, Caribbean pine plantations had the highest C but showed the lowest N stocks at both soil depths. Soil δ13C and δ15N values of all land uses increase with increasing soil depth; but Caribbean pine plantations showed the greatest increase in δ13C at both soil depths (e.g. −27.82 ± 0.38‰ at 0–10 cm to −26.50 ± 0.37‰ at 10–20 cm). For both Kekilla fernlands and Caribbean pine plantations the relationship between δ13C and δ15N was strongly linear. By comparing the physical and chemical soil properties of these land uses with undisturbed rain forest, we established baseline data to determine influence of land conversion on soil properties. Based on soil pH, CEC and other major nutrients (P, K, Mg), there are strong legacy effects of land use potentially from both fertilization and fire. Our results also showed strong evidence that δ13C and δ15N was both increased with depth under pine reforestation and fernlands, suggesting soils can recuperate with a consistent input of litter and slower decomposition processes. There is some evidence that recruitment of natural regeneration beneath pine can help facilitate faster litter decomposition that can revert soil structure and fertility to a status similar to that of the original forest. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Aims: Our understanding of the determinants of leaf litter decomposition is lacking for mixed evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forests compared with tropical and temperate forests. This study aimed to assess the relative importance of litter properties, climate and soil on decomposition in a mixed above-mentioned forest in a transitional zone, central China. Methods: We utilized leaf litter from seven canopy tree species in conjunction with a transplant litterbag experiment along an elevational gradient over three years by measuring decomposition rate. Results: Initial leaf litter nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and magnesium (Mg) as well as C:P were robust predictors of leaf litter decomposition. Mg was the single best predictor of leaf litter decomposition across all species. Soil moisture and air temperature could predict leaf litter decomposition very well across the elevational gradient. The explanatory power of elevation-related variables (27.75 %) was much lower than that of species-related variables (38.97 %). Conclusions: More nutrients such as Mg than N and P commonly used in proposed indices should be taken into account when evaluating the decomposability of leaf litter. Tree species identity is the most important determinant of leaf litter decomposition in this target transitional mixed forest. Therefore, shifts in tree species composition may influence leaf litter decomposition rates more than changes in site conditions under the context of future climate change. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the two most important elements for building plant proteins and genetic material, limiting forest production, and other ecosystem processes, and they profoundly affect litter decomposition. Litter-quality parameters, particularly initial lignin and N contents, ratios of C:N, and lignin:N often correlate strongly with rates of litter mass loss in temperate and boreal forests. Furthermore, soil N availability and N addition also affect litter decomposition. In tropical and subtropical forests, where highly weathered soil is frequently observed, P could be more important than N in inhibiting litter decomposition. However, P has not been considered in most current ecosystem carbon cycling models, but fertilization experiments show different responses of litter decomposition rates to nutrition addition. Synergistic, antagonistic, and neutral effects can be observed. Both the “ basic stoichiometric decomposition theory” and “ microbial nitrogen mining” hypothesis have been used to explain litter decomposition rate variations with nutrition addition. Regarding rigid C:N: P ratios in microbial decomposers, different nutrition sources could result in altered microbial activity, and limited nutrient supplies could result in restricted litter decomposition. To clearly understand the effects of N and P regulation on decomposition, we need longer decomposition experiment durations, more intensive field and laboratory fertilization experiments, and simultaneously, microbe and enzyme dynamics in the decomposition process should be further investigated. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

abstract={Several impacts arising from anthropogenic activities hinder ecosystem properties, but the effects of habitat area size on ecosystem functioning remain little known. We aimed to evaluate the effects of area size, and the associated abundance and species richness of collembola, oribatid mites and other arthropods on litter decomposition, phosphorus and nitrogen release within tropical forests. We designed a natural mesocosm experiment with plots varying in area size (0.16 – 3.24 m2), with both a control and a faunal limitation treatment (naphthalene addition). After 240 days we found lower litter decomposition and higher phosphorus release (both about 30%) in litterbags from the faunal limitation treatment. However, variations on these ecosystem properties were not related to area size, arthropod richness or abundance in this treatment, likely because of the loss of key species. Conversely, plots without faunal limitation showed a positive linear effect of area size on decomposition, and interactive effects among area size and collembolan richness, abundance and other arthropod richness. The larger the area, the smaller the positive role of collembola and other arthropod richness on decomposition, while the opposite pattern occurred for collembolan abundance. The indirect effects of arthropods on decomposition have a more significant role within smaller areas, which have a restricted microbial community with a lower array of fungal enzymes and foraging strategies available. As far as we know, this is the first evidence that the role of arthropods in decomposition may be mediated by area size, but only when arthropod biodiversity has not been reduced. We highlight the need for further assessments of these relationships in larger scales, while also measuring microbial communities, as the impact of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning may be even greater when coupled with habitat loss. © 2016 Ecological Society of Australia},

abstract={Molybdenum (Mo) and phosphorus (P) limitation and co-limitation of asymbiotic dinitrogen (N2) fixation has been reported in many ecosystems, from tropical to boreal. However, the mechanisms leading to these limitations remain elusive. In cold temperate forests Mo and P limitation of asymbiotic N2 fixation has been observed in gymnosperm litter but not in angiosperm litter suggesting an important role of the vegetative cover. In gymnosperm litters, P and Mo limitation is characterized by a strongly seasonality; P limitation was observed early in the growing season while Mo limitation appears midway in the growing season. This discrepancy between gymnosperm and angiosperm litters and the strong seasonality suggest that the quality of the litter and decomposition dynamics play an important role in the emergence of Mo and P limitation in gymnosperm litters from cold temperate ecosystems. While the dynamics of macronutrients (i.e. C, N) during decomposition are well documented, our understanding of micronutrient (i.e. trace metals) dynamics during litter decomposition remains limited. Here, we measured nutrient concentrations (P, Mo and others) during litter decomposition in various angiosperm and gymnosperm litters and their combinations (2 and 4 species) using litter bags. Results showed that angiosperm litter achieves higher nutrient concentrations (P and metals) than gymnosperm litter. The concentration of most elements increased in both litter types over a 6-month period of decomposition (Al, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, V, Ti, and Zn), with the exception of P and Mg which decreased over time. During decomposition, the concentration of Mo increased by ~300% in angiosperm litter but decreased by ~50% in gymnosperm litter. Together, these results suggest that the litter can concentrate metals from the surrounding environment (i.e. soil and atmospheric deposition) except for Mo in gymnosperm litter. Litter quality (nutrient concentration) and nutrient dynamics during litter decomposition likely play an important role in P and Mo limitation of asymbiotic N2 fixation. © 2016 .},

abstract={Aim: Terrestrial ecosystems sequester about 25% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions annually; however, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) limitation of plant productivity and microbial functioning could curtail this key ecosystem service in the future. Our aim is to address variations in nutrient resupply during decomposition - especially whether the N:P ratio of nutrient recycling via mineralization varies within and across diverse forest biomes. Location: Global forest ecosystems. Methods: We compiled data on in situ litter decomposition experiments (leaf, wood and root) from the primary literature to examine the relationships between net N and P mineralization across temperate versus tropical forests world-wide. We define net nutrient mineralization ratios as the average N:P released from decomposing substrates at a given ecosystem site. Results: We show that net N and P mineralization are strongly correlated within biomes, suggesting strong coupling between N and P recycling in forest ecosystems. The net N:P of leaf-litter mineralization is higher in tropical forests than in temperate forests, consistent with latitudinal patterns in foliar and leaf-litter N:P. At the global scale, the N:P of net mineralization tracks, but tends to be lower than that of litter N:P, pointing to preferential P (versus N) mineralization in forest ecosystems. Main conclusions: Our results do not support the view that there is a single, globally consistent mineralization N:P ratio. Instead, our results show that the N:P of net mineralization can be predicted by the N:P of litter, offering a method for incorporating P into global-scale models of carbon-nutrient-climate interactions. In addition, these results imply that P is scarce relative to microbial decomposer demands in tropical forests, whereas N and P may be more co-limiting when compared with microbial biomass in the temperate zone. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Background and Aims: Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has elevated rapidly in tropical regions where N2-fixing tree species are widespread. However, the effect of N deposition on litter decomposition in forests with N2-fixing tree species remains unclear. We examined the effect of N addition on litter decomposition and nutrient release in two tropical plantations with Acacia auriculiformis (AA, N2-fixing) and Eucalyptus urophylla (EU, non-N2-fixing) in South China. Methods: Three levels of N additions were conducted: control, medium-N (50 kg N ha−1 yr.−1) and high-N (100 kg N ha−1 yr.−1) in each plantation. Results: Initial decomposition rate (ka) for the control plots was faster in the AA plantation than in the EU plantation, but later in decomposition, larger fraction of slowly decomposing litter (A) remained in the former. N addition increased the slow fraction (A), decreasing soil microbial biomass and reducing acid-unhydrolyzable residue (AUR) degradation in the AA plantation. In the EU plantation, however, N additions significantly increased initial decomposition rate (ka) and soil N availability. Furthermore, N addition decreased litter carbon and N release (in the AA plantation), while litter phosphorus release also decreased in both plantations. Conclusions: With ongoing N deposition in future, tropical plantations with N2-fixing tree species would potentially increase carbon accumulation and nutrient retention in forest floor by slowing litter decomposition. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Litter production and decomposition are key processes controlling the capacity of wetland to store and cycle carbon (C) and nutrients. Typhoons deposit large amounts of green and semi-green (between green and withered) plant tissues and withered litter (normal litter) on wetland soils, generating a pulse of litter production. Climatic models project an increase in typhoon intensity and frequency. Elucidating the impacts of typhoons on C, N and P cycles and storage capacities in subtropical and tropical wetland areas is thus important. We analyzed the patterns and changes of litter decomposition after a typhoon in the Minjiang River estuary in southeastern China. Green litter decomposed the fastest, and the loss of mass did not differ significantly between semi-green litter, withered litter and mixed litter (all soil litter after a typhoon). During the decomposition process the remaining green litter had the highest, and withered litter the lowest N and P concentrations. The biomass loss rate of litter during the studied period was related to the initial litter N and P concentrations. Remaining litter generally increased its N:P ratio during decomposition. The ratio of the released N and P was consequently lower than the initial N:P ratio in all litter types. The typhoon enhanced the release of C, N and P from the litter (884, 12.3 and 6 kg ha-1, respectively) by 264 days after the typhoon. The soil was accordingly enriched with organic matter and nutrients for several months, which should favor microbial growth rates (higher C, N and P availability and lower C:nutrient and N:P ratios) and increase the rates of C and nutrient cycling. If the frequency and/or intensity of typhoons increase, a constant increase in the release of N and P to the soil with lower N:P ratios could change the N and P cycles in wetlands and provide better conditions for the spread of fast-growing species. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Unlike Eucalyptus monocultures, nitrogen fixing trees are likely to improve the soil nutrient status through the decomposition of N-enriched litter. The Home Field Advantage (HFA) hypothesis states that plants can create conditions that increase the decomposition rates of their own litter. However, there may not be any HFA when most of the decomposers are generalists. A reciprocal transplant decomposition experiment of fine roots and leaves of Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus grandis was undertaken in monocultures of these two species to test the HFA hypothesis using a complete randomized design with three blocks. Three litterbags containing leaf or fine root residues of each species were collected every 3 months from each plot over 12 months for fine roots and 24 months for leaves. The litter mass and C, N and P concentrations were measured at each sampling date. The concentrations of C-compounds were measured 0, 12 and 24 months from the start of the experiment. There was no evidence of HFA for either the leaves or the fine roots of either species. The decomposition rates were slower for Acacia litter than for Eucalyptus litter even though initial N concentrations were 1.9-2.9 times higher and P concentrations were 1.5-3.3 times higher in the Acacia residues. N:P ratios were greater than 20-30 for the residues of both species, with the highest values for Acacia. Litter decomposition depended partly on the C quality of the litter, primarily in terms of water soluble compounds and lignin content. As shown recently in tropical rainforests, these results suggest that the activity of decomposers is limited by energy starvation in tropical planted forests. Decomposer activity may also have been limited by P availability which may not have been directly related to the P concentrations or C:P ratios in the residues. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability both control microbial decomposers and litter decomposition. However, these two key nutrients show distinct release patterns from decomposing litter and are unlikely available at the same time in most ecosystems. Little is known about how temporal differences in N and P availability affect decomposers and litter decomposition, which may be particularly critical for tropical rainforests growing on old and nutrient-impoverished soils. Here we used three chemically contrasted leaf litter substrates and cellulose paper as a widely accessible substrate containing no nutrients to test the effects of temporal differences in N and P availability in a microcosm experiment under fully controlled conditions. We measured substrate mass loss, microbial activity (by substrate induced respiration, SIR) as well as microbial community structure (using phospholipid fatty acids, PLFAs) in the litter and the underlying soil throughout the initial stages of decomposition. We generally found a stronger stimulation of substrate mass loss and microbial respiration, especially for cellulose, with simultaneous NP addition compared to a temporally separated N and P addition. However, litter types with a relatively high N to P availability responded more to initial P than N addition and vice versa. A third litter species showed no response to fertilization regardless of the sequence of addition, likely due to strong C limitation. Microbial community structure in the litter was strongly influenced by the fertilization sequence. In particular, the fungi to bacteria ratio increased following N addition alone, a shift that was reversed with complementary P addition. Opposite to the litter layer microorganisms, the soil microbial community structure was more strongly influenced by the identity of the decomposing substrate than by fertilization treatments, reinforcing the idea that C availability can strongly constrain decomposer communities. Collectively, our data support the idea that temporal differences in N and P availability are critical for the activity and the structure of microbial decomposer communities. The interplay of N, P, and substrate-specific C availability will strongly determine how nutrient pulses in the environment will affect microbial heterotrophs and the processes they drive. © 2016 Fanin, Hättenschwiler, Chavez Soria and Fromin.},

abstract={Nitrogen (N) exerts strong effects on litter decomposition through altering microbial abundance and community composition. However, the effect of N addition on plant-soil interactions such as home-field advantage (HFA: enhanced decomposition at a home environment compared to a guest environment) in relation to litter decomposition remains unclear. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a reciprocal litter transplant plus N addition experiment in Mytilaria laosensis and Cunninghamia lanceolata plantations for two years in subtropical China where anthropogenic N input is amongst the highest in the world. We found positive HFA effects (in which the calculation incorporates litter of both species) with litter mass loss 11.2% faster at home than in the guest environment in the N addition (50 kg N ha-1 yr-1) treatment, but no significant HFA effects were found in the control treatment. The magnitude of the HFA effect on carbon (C) release increased with N addition, while that on N release decreased. The HFA effects on phosphorus, potassium, calcium, sodium, and magnesium release were positive overall, but varied through time and the magnitude of the effects were different among elements. The greater HFA effects in the N addition treatment were associated with greater differences in microbial biomass and community composition between home and guest environments than in the control treatment. Our results indicate that anthropogenic N enrichment could lead to enhanced HFA effects, through modification of microbial communities, and thereby affect C sequestration and N cycling in subtropical forests. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background and aims: Global change drivers such as climate change influence decomposition by altering extrinsic site conditions and intrinsic litter traits. This study aimed to quantify the relative importance of these two pathways for litter decomposition in tropical forests. Methods: The effects of soil nutrient availability, mean annual precipitation (MAP), and leaf litter chemistry on decomposition were isolated by measuring mass loss of leaf litter from 10 tropical tree species transplanted to 19 sites along independent gradients of soil fertility and precipitation in Panama. Across species, litter nitrogen (N) content ranged from 7.1 to 13 mg N g−1 and phosphorus (P) from 0.077 to 0.56 mg P g−1. Across sites, soil N content ranged from 1.7 to 5.5 g N kg−1, soil P from 77 to 1500 mg P kg−1, and MAP from 1900 to 2700 mm. Results: Variation in leaf litter mass loss was explained largely by litter species identity (55 %). Site only explained a small, but significant, amount of variance (6.5 %); soil C:N ratio explained this response. Notably, neither litter nutrient content nor MAP were significant predictors of litter decomposition. Conclusions: Changes in tree species composition may influence decomposition rates more than changes to site conditions. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Sodium (Na) is unimportant to plants but critical for detritivore decomposers in brown food webs. Na's limiting impact on detritivores and decomposition in inland tropical forest has already been demonstrated, but its role in regulating microbial decomposers remains unexplored. This study filled in this gap by assessing the response of detritivores and microorganisms to three levels of Na subsidies (0.005%, 0.05% and 0.5% water solution of NaCl) during the decomposition of broad-leaf and needle litter in a subtropical forest (Nanjing, China, 300. km inland from Pacific ocean). The relative contributions of detritivores vs microbes to litter decomposition were tested using litterbags with 5. mm and 0.2. mm mesh. Litter mass loss, soil microbial respiration, and soil enzyme activities were investigated in an eight-month field experiment. Our results showed that both 0.05 and 0.5% Na subsidies increased invertebrate detritivore decomposition of litter at least 1.5 fold, while it decreased the microbial contribution to litter decomposition by ≥7.2%. However, low-level Na subsidies (0.005%) increased microbial, but not detritivore, activity in recalcitrant litter. Despite enhanced litter mass loss from invertebrate detritivores, we found decreased microbial enzyme activities involved in carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling under high (0.5%) Na subsidies. This suggests that at 0.5% of Na, microbes experience Na-toxicity and mineralization of C, N, and P nutrients likely decreased in forest ecosystems. These results suggest that neither Na shortage nor Na excess would be unfavorable for carbon-release. As increased with anthropogenic input or climate change in the future, sodium may have multiple effects on soil organic matter dynamics, ecosystem biogeochemical cycling, and plant nutrition through regulating microbial processes in forests. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Elevated nitrogen (N) deposition may constrain soil phosphorus (P) and base cation availability in tropical forests, for which limited evidence have yet been available. In this study, we reported responses of soil inorganic nutrients to full factorial N and P treatments in three tropical forests different in initial soil N status (N-saturated old-growth forest and two less-N-rich younger forests). Responses of microbial biomass, annual litterfall production and nutrient input were also monitored. Results showed that N treatments decreased soil inorganic nutrients (except N) in all three forests, but the underlying mechanisms varied depending on forests: through inhibition on litter decomposition in the old-growth forest and through Al 3+ replacement of Ca2+ in the two younger forests. In contrast, besides great elevation in soil available P, P treatments induced 60%, 50%, 26% increases in sum of exchangeable (K+ +Ca2+ +Mg2+) in the old-growth and the two younger forests, respectively. These positive effects of P were closely related to P-stimulated microbial biomass and litter nutrient input, implying possible stimulation of nutrient return. Our results suggest that N deposition may result in decreases in soil inorganic nutrients (except N) and that P addition can enhance soil inorganic nutrients to support ecosystem processes in these tropical forests.},

abstract={Soil organic matter (SOM) and microbial activity are key components of soil quality and sustainability. In the humid tropics of Costa Rica 3 pesticide regimes were studied-fungicide (low input); fungicide and herbicide (medium input); and fungicide, herbicide, and nematicide (high input)-under continuous banana cultivation for 5 yr (young) or 20 yr (old) in 3 microhabitats-nematicide ring around plants, litter pile of harvested banana, and bare area between litter pile and nematicide ring. Soil samples were incubated sequentially in the laboratory: unamended, amended with glucose, and amended with ground banana leaves. Soil organic matter varied with microhabitat, being greatest in the litter pile, where microbes had the greatest basal respiration with ground banana leaf, whereas microbes in the nematicide ring had the greatest respiration with glucose. These results suggest that soil microbes adapt to specific microhabitats. Young banana plantations had similar SOM compared with old plantations, but the former had greater basal microbial respiration in unamended and in glucose-amended soil and greater first-order mineralization rates in glucose-amended soil, thus indicating soil biological quality decline over time. High pesticide input did not decrease microbial activity or mineralization rate in surface soil. In conclusion, microbial activity in tropical volcanic soil is highly adaptable to organic and inorganic inputs. © 2015 SETAC.},

abstract={Global changes such as increasing CO2, rising temperature, and land-use change are likely to drive shifts in litter inputs to forest floors, but the effects of such changes on litter decomposition remain largely unknown. We initiated a litter manipulation experiment to test the response of litter decomposition to litter removal/addition in three successional forests in southern China, namely masson pine forest (MPF), mixed coniferous and broadleaved forest (MF) and monsoon evergreen broadleaved forest (MEBF). Results showed that litter removal decreased litter decomposition rates by 27%, 10% and 8% and litter addition increased litter decomposition rates by 55%, 36% and 14% in MEBF, MF and MPF, respectively. The magnitudes of changes in litter decomposition were more significant in MEBF forest and less significant in MF, but not significant in MPF. Our results suggest that change in litter quantity can affect litter decomposition, and this impact may become stronger with forest succession in tropical forest ecosystem. © 2014 Chen et al.},

abstract={The current rapid decline in biodiversity has led to concerns about the consequences for stream ecosystem processes, one of which is the decomposition of leaf litter derived from riparian vegetation. We conducted field experiments in a tropical and a temperate stream to test for the effects of mixing leaf species differing in resource quality on the decomposition of leaf litter and on the colonisation of the litter by leaf-shredding invertebrates. The effects of litter mixing were minor compared with the effects of litter quality and the presence or absence of shredders. Low shredder abundance in the tropical stream and poor quality of the tropical leaf species, particularly in terms of phosphorus content and toughness, were associated with low decomposition rates in the tropical compared with the temperate stream. This is especially true when considering the 20 °C temperature differences between the two streams. In the presence of shredders, the decomposition rate of a standard litter type, leaves of Alnus glutinosa, was 2.6-fold faster in the temperate stream, whereas rates were similar when shredders were absent. This indicates that differences in environmental conditions other than temperature had a strong effect. Differences in water chemistry, such as higher concentrations of dissolved nutrients in the temperate stream, might account for this effect. In conclusion, despite a lack of clear effects of litter mixing on decomposition, our results highlight the importance of litter identity and environmental conditions for both microbial and shredder-mediated litter decomposition, suggesting that changes in riparian vegetation and other stream characteristics will affect stream ecosystems in the face of widespread environmental change. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Litter decomposition is a major driver of nutrient availability and carbon (C) cycling in forest ecosystems, and may be susceptible to perturbation by exogenous nutrient inputs from anthropogenic activity. The role of resource limitation in this process is unclear, although some models suggest the macronutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stimulate early-stage decomposition while availability of labile C restricts later-stage decomposition. We studied this interplay in a subtropical mixed forest in southern China through in situ incubations of litter samples over a 540-day period. Litter samples were amended with labile C (+C, as sucrose), N (+N, as NH4NO3), P (+P, as NaH2PO4), all three inputs (+CNP), or no inputs (CK). Litter mass and nutrient content were measured at 90-day intervals, while extractable carbohydrate profiles of the litter samples were assayed at 90, 270, and 450days of incubation. The +P and +CNP treatments showed greater reductions in litter mass, as well as a larger P pool throughout the incubation. The +N treatment had a larger N pool, but otherwise did not differ from the no input control CK. The concentration of accessible carbohydrate fractions remained constant or increased from 90 to 450days of incubation, while less accessible fractions thought to be lignocellulose and hemi-cellulose decreased during that period. Total extractable carbohydrates decreased in the +P treatment, but was not significantly different among other treatments. Our results suggest that mixed forest systems in southern China are likely to be minimally perturbed in the short term by exogenous N addition, and that decomposition activity is not regulated by labile C availability over the time period studied. Moreover, increased C inputs due to climate change-induced changes in litter deposition and root exudation will likely have a smaller impact on subtropical forest management than anthropogenic disturbances such as P fertilization. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Litter decay is a significant part of carbon budget. Due to strong environmental control, the changes in the environment may drastically influence the litter decay rates. Litter decomposition of eight dry tropical woody species, viz. Shorea robusta, Buchanania lanzan, Diospyros melanoxylon, Lagerstroemia parviflora, Lannea coromandelica, Terminalia tomentosa, Holarrhena antidysenterica and Lantana camara was studied to document the effect of intra-annual changes in the environment. Litter decomposition was monitored at monthly intervals at five sites using litter bag technique over an annual cycle in a dry tropical deciduous forest of Vindhyan highland, India. Weight loss differed among species and through months, and ranged from 15.38% in L. camara at Kotwa site in January to 30.72% in T. tomentosa at Hathinala site in August. Peak weight loss occurred in August and averaged 46.2% across species and sites. Nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization rates also varied significantly from species to species. T. tomentosa having higher nitrogen content and lower C/N ratio than other species exhibited faster weight loss. Nitrogen and phosphorus contents of litter showed significant positive correlation with weight loss. C/N ratio was negatively related to decay constant, and the weight loss was positively related to the soil surface temperature as well as soil moisture content. © 2013 Societá Botanica Italiana.},

We expected microorganisms and microbial grazers (testate amoebae) to significantly respond to nutrient additions with the effect increasing with increasing altitude and with duration of nutrient additions. Further, we expected nutrients to alter grazer-prey interrelationships. Indeed, nutrient additions strongly altered microbial biomass (MB) and community structure as well as the community structure of testate amoebae. The response of microorganisms varied with both altitude and duration of nutrient addition. The results indicate that microorganisms are generally limited by N, but saprotrophic fungi also by P. Also, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi benefited from N and/or P addition. Parallel to MB, testate amoebae benefited from the addition of N but were detrimentally affected by P, with the addition of P negating the positive effect of N. Our data suggests that testate amoeba communities are predominantly structured by abiotic factors and by antagonistic interactions with other microorganisms, in particular mycorrhizal fungi, rather than by the availability of prey. Overall, the results suggest that the decomposer system of tropical montane rainforests significantly responds to even moderate changes in nutrient inputs with the potential to cause major ramifications of the whole ecosystem including litter decomposition and plant growth. © 2014 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

abstract={We compared the N and P contents of the main labile components of nutrient cycles in three different forest ecosystems [a tropical evergreen forest (TEF); a tropical dry forest (TDF); and a Mediterranean temperate forest (MTF)] with low P supply. A mass-balance approach was used to estimate mean residence times for organic matter, N and P in the forest floor, and to examine the flexibility of N and P intra-system cycling in the three forest ecosystems. For this purpose, we combined published values of N and P in foliage, litterfall, forest floor litter and mineral soils in these three forest ecosystems. The results of our analysis were consistent with the widely held belief that the N content of leaves (both green and senescent) and litter increases with increasing temperatures. In contrast, the data did not support the hypothesis that leaf P content decreases with increasing temperatures and precipitation: leaf and litterfall P contents were higher in both tropical forests than they were in the temperate forest. The TEF had the highest P content of the three forests studied. The mass-balance analysis indicated that although P mineralization in the TDF can run ahead of litter decomposition stoichiometry when P is in short supply, flexibility is much reduced or absent in the TEF and the MTF. Our analysis provides additional evidence of the importance of climatic factors in forest ecosystem processes and highlights the role of flexibility in ecosystem nutrient cycling, especially for P in ecosystems with a limited P supply. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Summary: Litter decomposition is a key ecosystem process, yet our understanding of the drivers in chemical changes in leaves during decay is limited. Our aim was to determine the comparative differences (chemical divergence or convergence) between sites and the drivers of decay pathways. We used the litterbag method ('in situ' litterfall and standardized 'control' leaves) in Australian tropical rainforests and near-infrared spectrometry to show the chemical pathways during decomposition (c. 360 d; 12 control sites; 17 in situ sites). Chemical convergence/divergence was determined from spectral dissimilarity and quantile regression along a mass loss moving average. The influence of environment (climate and soil) and litter quality on decay pathways was determined between sites using correlation analysis. Throughout the region, litter composition in both treatments converged chemically during decay. However, divergent chemical pathways were shown for some samples/sites (especially with high initial lignin, phenolics and carbon (C), poor soil phosphorus (P), sodium (Na) and more seasonal moisture), and the diversity of decay residues increased with mass loss despite overall chemical convergence. Our study suggests that there is general chemical convergence of leaf litter during early decay, but also that divergent chemical pathways occur in locations that experience more intense seasonal drying, and contain species or conditions that promote poor-quality litter. © 2014 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract={Litter decomposition in communities dominated by emergent macrophytes can be considered a two-phased decomposition process, a standing phase followed by decay on the sediment surface. We examined the decomposition and nutrient dynamics in both phases of three structural components (leaves, flowers, stems) of two common emergent macrophytes in the Min River estuary, southeast China. The two species were Phragmites australis, a native species, and Spartina alterniflora an invasive one. Decomposition was slower in the standing phase compared to the sediment surface phase for most structural components of both species. In the standing and sediment surface phase, the exponential breakdown rates (k-value) for all structural components of S. alterniflora were much greater than the corresponding values for P australis. The k-values in different components of P. australis and S. alterniflora ranged from 0.96 to 1.79×10-3d-1 and 1.67 to 4.58×10-3d-1 in the standing phase, and from 1.60 to 5.32×10-3d-1 and 3.05 to 6.93×10-3d-1 in the sediment surface phase, for the two species, respectively. Over the 210 day study, the litter carbon concentrations in three structural components of P. australis fluctuated considerably compared to S. alterniflora. The variations in nitrogen concentration of flower and stem litter in both species experienced a similar pattern throughout the experimental period, in the sediment surface phase, although the nitrogen concentration increased in both species. Litter phosphorus concentration showed a completely different pattern between the two species throughout. © 2014.},

abstract={The responses of litter decomposition to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) additions were examined in an old-growth tropical forest in southern China to test the following hypotheses: (1) N addition would decrease litter decomposition; (2) P addition would increase litter decomposition, and (3) P addition would mitigate the inhibitive effect of N addition. Two kinds of leaf litter, Schima superba Chardn. &amp; Champ. (S.S.) and Castanopsis chinensis Hance (C.C.), were studied using the litterbag technique. Four treatments were conducted at the following levels: control, N-addition (150 kg N ha-1 yr-1), P-addition (150 kg P ha-1 yr-1) and NP-addition (150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 plus 150 kg P ha -1 yr-1). While N addition significantly decreased the decomposition of both litters, P addition significantly inhibited decomposition of C.C., but did not affect the decomposition of S.S. The negative effect of N addition on litter decomposition might be related to the high N-saturation in this old-growth tropical forest; however, the negative effect of P addition might be due to the suppression of "microbial P mining". Significant interaction between N and P addition was found on litter decomposition, which was reflected by the less negative effect in NP-addition plots than those in N-addition plots. Our results suggest that P addition may also have negative effect on litter decomposition and that P addition would mitigate the negative effect of N deposition on litter decomposition in tropical forests. © 2013 Chen et al.},

abstract={Although bacteria and fungi are well-known to be decomposers of leaf litter, few studies have examined their compositions and diversities during the decomposition process in tropical stream water. Xishuangbanna is a tropical region preserving one of the highest floristic diversity areas in China. In this study, leaf litter of four dominant plant species in Xishuangbanna was incubated in stream water for 42 days during which samples were taken regularly. Following DNA extraction, PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and clone-sequencing analyses were performed using bacterial and fungal specific primers. Leaf species have slightly influences on bacterial community rather than fungal community. The richness and diversity of bacteria was higher than that of fungi, which increased towards the end of the 42-day-incubation. The bacterial community was initially more specific upon the type of leaves and gradually became similar at the later stage of decomposition with alpha-proteobacteria as major component. Sequences affiliated to methanotrophs were obtained that indicates potentially occurrence of methane oxidation and methanogenesis. For the fungal community, sequences affiliated to Aspergillus were predominant at the beginning and then shifted to Pleosporales. Our results suggest that the microorganisms colonizing leaf biofilm in tropical stream water were mostly generalists that could exploit the resources of leaves of various species equally well. © 2013 Xu et al.},

abstract={A experiment on leaf litter decomposition was carried out to evaluate the effects of UV-B radiation on the chemical composition and subsequent decomposition of leaf litter in humid subtropical forest systems. The leaf litter was derived from Cyclobalanopsis glauca seedlings exposed to elevated and ambient ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation treatments during growth for one year. The results showed that UV-B treatment significantly increased the original N, K and P content of leaf litter by 154.9%, 29.8% and 9.7%, respectively, and decreased the ratios of C:N, lignin:N and C:P of leaf litter by 60.5%, 61.7% and 8.5%, respectively (P<0.05), but had no significant effect on C and lignin content. The decomposition of leaf litter derived from seedlings exposed to elevated UV-B treatment during growth was faster, but did not show significant difference from that of ambient UV-B treatment. Exposure to elevated UV-B radiation during growth did not significantly influence the K release, but promoted the P release and retarded the N accumulation during leaf litter decomposition. Our result will contribute to the better understanding of the role of UV-B radiation in moist subtropical forest ecosystem.},

abstract={Assemblage of aquatic hyphomycetes and decomposition of banyan leaf litter (Ficus benghalensis) were assessed in riparian tree holes and in a tropical coastal stream during rainy season up to 8 weeks in south-west coast of India. Although fungal assemblage was similar, leaf decomposition and leaf chemical changes differed between tree holes and the stream. Out of the 18 aquatic hyphomycetes, 17 were common on leaf litter in tree holes and the stream. Anguillospora longissima, Flagellospora curvula, Lunulospora curvula, Triscelophorus acuminatus and T. konajensis were the top five species in tree holes and the stream. The species richness was the highest during the second week in tree holes (11 species) and the sixth week in the stream (14 species), while the conidial output was the highest in tree holes and the stream during sixth week. The daily decay coefficient (k) was significantly faster in streams than in tree holes. Mass loss of banyan leaves between tree holes and the stream was positively correlated with conidial output by the aquatic hyphomycetes. The estimated half-life (t50) of leaf decomposition ranged between 70 days (stream) and 128 days (tree holes). Organic carbon in leaf litter gradually decreased, while nitrogen content decreased up to 1-2 weeks and then gradually increased over the incubation period. Ergosterol showed a gradual increase in tree hole litter, while it attained its peak in 4 weeks and declined thereafter in the stream litter. Loss of phosphorus concentration was rapid in the stream than in tree holes. Total phenolics concentration in leaves decreased rapidly in the stream than in tree holes. However, low dissolved oxygen in water and the slow release of phenolics from the leaf litter showed negative impact on the fungal activity and the rate of leaf decomposition in tree holes. © 2013 Copyright Mycological Society of China.},

abstract={Azadirachta indica is a tree species which use is steadily increasing for restoration of tropical and subtropical arid and degraded lands throughout the world. The objective of this research study was to evaluate the potential of these plantations as an active restoration model for the recovery of soils under desertification in arid lands of Colombia. Litter traps and litter-bags were installed in twenty 250m2 plots. Green leaves and soil samples inside and outside this species plantations were taken, and their elemental concentrations were determined. Litterfall, leaf litter decomposition and foliar nutrient resorption were monitored for one year. The annual contributions of organic material, such as fine litterfall, represented 557.54kg/ha, a third of which was A. indica leaves. The greatest potential returns of nutrients per foliar litterfall were from Ca (4.6kg/ha) and N (2.4kg/ha), and the smallest potential returns came from P (0.06kg/ha). A total of 68% of the foliar material deposited in litter-bags disappeared after one year. The greatest release of nutrients was that of K (100%), and the least was that of N (40%). P was the most limiting nutrient, with low edaphic availability and high nutrient use efficiency from Vitousek ́s index (IEV=3176) and foliar nutrient resorption (35%). Despite these plantations are young, and that they have not had forestry management practices, as an active restoration model, they have revitalized the biogeochemical cycle, positively modifying the edaphic parameters according to the increases in organic material, P and K of 72%, 31% and 61%, respectively. Furthermore, they improved the stability of aggregates and the microbe respiration rates. The forest plantation model with exotic species has been opposed by different sectors; however, it has been acknowledged that these projects derive many benefits for the restoration of biodiversity and ecosystemic functions. The conditions of severe land degradation demand the initial use of species, such as A. indica, that can adapt quickly and successfully, and progressively reestablish the biogeochemical cycle.},

The non-flooded treatment reduced the mass remaining after 14 months from 84 to 81 % for Raphia taedigera, 65 to 58 % for Campnosperma panamensis, and 69 to 58 % for Cyperus sp. The proportions of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the labile, semi-labile and recalcitrant carbon pools, did not reliably predict differences among species in the mass loss rate of litter. Phosphorus was rapidly lost from litter, while carbon losses, including soluble carbon, were slower, but significant for all fractions. The nonflooded treatment substantially reduced the quantity of C remaining in the residue fraction of leaf litter after 12 weeks, with 31, 19 and 6 % less remaining in the non-flooded treatment for R. taedigera, C. panamensis and Cyperus sp. This suggests that lower water table depth on litter decay increase degradation of mainly aliphatic and aromatic carbon in the residual fraction. Thus, although lowering the water table increased decomposition, the chemical composition of litter clearly influences peat accumulation. © US Government 2013.},

abstract={Leaching is a mechanism for the release of nutrients from litter or senesced leaves that can drive interactions among plants, microbes, and soil. Although leaching is well established in conceptual models of litter decomposition, potential nutrient solubility of mineral elements from recently senesced litter has seldom been quantified. Using a standardized extraction (1:50 litter-to-water ratio and four-hour extraction) and recently senesced leaf litter of 41 tropical tree and liana species, we investigated how solubility varies among elements, and whether the solubility of elements could be predicted by litter traits (e.g., lignin, total element concentrations). In addition, we investigated nutrient forms (i.e., inorganic and organic) and ratios in leachate. Water-soluble elements per unit litter mass were strongly predicted by total initial litter element concentrations for potassium (K; r2 = 0.79), sodium (Na; r2 = 0.51) and phosphorus (P; r2 = 0.66), while a significant but weaker positive relationship was found for nitrogen (N; r2 = 0.36). There was no significant relationship for carbon (C) or calcium (Ca). Element-specific solubility varied markedly. On average 100% of total K, 35% of total P, 28% of total Na, 5% of total N, 4% of total Ca, and 3% of total C were soluble. For soluble P, 90% was inorganic orthophosphate. The high solubility of K, Na, and P as inorganic orthophosphate suggests that these nutrients can become rapidly available to litter microbes with no metabolic cost. Few common predictors of decomposition rates were correlated with element solubility, although soluble C (milligrams per gram of litter) was negatively related to lignin content (r2 = 0.19; P , 0.004). Solubility of elements was linked within a species: when a species ranked high in the soluble fraction of one element, it also ranked high in the solubility of other elements. Overall nutrient-specific patterns of solubility from recently senesced litter emphasize that litter elements cannot be treated equally in our conceptual and empirical models of decomposition. The relatively high potential solubility of P as orthophosphate from fresh litter advances our understanding of ecological stoichiometric ratios and nutrient bioavailability in tropical forests. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Human-caused alterations of the carbon and nutrient cycles are expected to impact tropical ecosystems in the near future. Here we evaluated how a combined change in carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability affects soil and litter microbial respiration and litter decomposition in an undisturbed Amazonian rainforest in French Guiana. In a fully factorial C (as cellulose), N (as urea), and P (as phosphate) fertilization experiment we analyzed a total of 540 litterbag-soil pairs after a 158-day exposure in the field. Rates of substrate-induced respiration (SIR) measured in litter and litter mass loss were similarly affected by fertilization showing the strongest stimulation when N and P were added simultaneously. The stimulating NP effect on litter SIR increased considerably with increasing initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in litter, suggesting that the combined availability of N, P, and a labile C source has a particularly strong effect on microbial activity. Cellulose fertilization, however, did not further stimulate the NP effect. In contrast to litter SIR and litter mass loss, soil SIR was reduced with N fertilization and showed only a positive effect in response to P fertilization that was further enhanced with additional C fertilization. Our data suggest that increased nutrient enrichment in the studied Amazonian rainforest can considerably change microbial activity and litter decomposition, and that these effects differ between the litter layer and the underlying soil. Any resulting change in relative C and nutrient fluxes between the litter layer and the soil can have important consequences for biogeochemical cycles in tropical forest ecosystems. © 2012 Fanin et al.},

abstract={Tropical forests determine global biogeochemical cycles to a large extent, but control factors for key ecosystem processes such as decomposition remain poorly understood. With a full-factorial C (cellulose), N (urea), and P (phosphate) fertilization experiment, we tested the relative importance of C and nutrient limitation on litter decomposition in a mature lowland moist forest of French Guiana. Despite the previously demonstrated litter C quality control over decomposition and the very low soil P content (0. 1 mg g-1 of soil) at our study site, fertilization with C or P alone did not increase the decomposition of a wide range of litter types (N:P ratios between 20 and 80). Nitrogen fertilization alone also had no effect on decomposition. However, the combined fertilization with N and P resulted in up to 33. 5% more initial litter mass lost, with an increasing effect with wider litter N:P ratios. Soil fauna strongly stimulated litter mass loss and enhanced nutrient fertilization effects. Moreover, nutrient effects on decomposition increased with additional C fertilization in the presence of fauna. Our results suggest that increased N availability is required for a positive P effect on decomposition in the studied P-poor tropical forest. Further stimulation of decomposition by C amendment through priming indicates energy limitation of decomposers that is co-determined by nutrient availability. The demonstrated intricate control of the key resources C, N, and P on decomposition calls for an intensified research effort on multiple resource limitation on key processes in tropical forests and how they change under multiple human impacts. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Community functioning may be affected by functional diversity, which measures the extent of complementarity in resource use. We tested whether there was a relationship between functional diversity of woody species and community functioning on a fine scale, using FD as a measure of functional diversity and litter decomposition rate as a surrogate for community functioning. We measured eight functional traits from a woodland cerrado community in southeastern Brazil. Then, we tested the correlation between FD and the decomposition rate taking into account differences in soil features and between decomposition rate and each trait separately. The decomposition rate was related to the aluminium and phosphorus concentration in soil, but not to FD, pointing out that functional diversity was not a good predictor of community functioning. There was a non-significant relationship between FD and the decomposition rate even when we considered each trait separately. Most studies in the relationships between biodiversity and community functioning on fine scales were carried out by experimental manipulation of diversity and in temperate regions. We carried out this fine scale study as a mensurative experiment and in a tropical savanna. Our findings indicated that the relationship between biodiversity and community functioning is not as straightforward as usually assumed.},

abstract={The decomposition of leaf litter is governed, in part, by litter invertebrates. In tropical rain forests, ants are dominant predators in the leaf litter and may alter litter decomposition through the action of a top-down control of food web structure. The role of ants in litter decomposition was investigated in a Costa Rican lowland rain forest with two experiments. In a mesocosm experiment, we manipulated ant presence in 50 ambient leaf-litter mesocosms. In a litterbag gradient experiment, Cecropia obtusifolia litter was used to measure decomposition rate constants across gradients in nutrients, ant density and richness, with 27 separate litterbag treatments for total arthropod exclusion or partial arthropod exclusion. After 2 mo, mass loss in mesocosms containing ants was 30.9%, significantly greater than the 23.5% mass loss in mesocosms without ants. In the litter bags with all arthropods excluded, decomposition was best accounted by the carbon: phosphorus content of soil (r2 = 0.41). In litter bags permitting smaller arthropods but excluding ants, decomposition was best explained by the local biomass of ants in the vicinity of the litter bags (r2 = 0.50). Once the microarthropod prey of ants are permitted to enter litterbags, the biomass of ants near the litterbags overtakes soil chemistry as the regulator of decomposition. In concert, these results support a working hypothesis that litter-dwelling ants are responsible for accelerating litter decomposition in lowland tropical rain forests. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Scant information is available on how soil phosphorus (P) availability responds to atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition, especially in the tropical zones. This study examined the effect of N addition on soil P availability, and compared this effect between forest sites of contrasting land-use history. Effects of N addition on soil properties, litterfall production, P release from decomposing litter, and soil P availability were studied in a disturbed (reforested pine forest with previous understory vegetation and litter harvesting) and a rehabilitated (reforested mixed pine/broadleaf forest with no understory vegetation and litter harvesting) tropical forest in southern China. Experimental N-treatments (above ambient) were the following: Control (no N addition), N50 (50 kg N ha -1 yr -1), and N100 (100 kg N ha -1 yr -1). Results indicated that N addition significantly decreased soil P availability in the disturbed forest. In the rehabilitated forest, however, soil P availability was significantly increased by N addition. Decreases in soil P availability may be correlated with decreases in rates of P release from decomposing litter in the N-treated plots, whereas the increase in soil P availability was correlated with an increase in litterfall production. Our results suggest that response of soil P availability to N deposition in the reforested tropical forests in southern China may vary greatly with temporal changes in tree species composition and soil nutrient status, caused by different land-use practices. © 2011 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract={In tropical ecosystems, access to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) limits the decomposition rate of leaf-litter. Leaf-litter ants are abundant in this microhabitat and present a wide variety of diets. Our aim was to study the response of various ant trophic groups to an increased nutrient availability which boosts the decomposition of their habitat and selectively affects the abundance of their prey.A 6-month nutrient addition experiment (CN, CNP) was performed in a tropical montane forest of the Ecuadorian Andes. The density of ants, of other predators (e.g. arachnids, beetles) and of their potential prey (mesofauna, ranging from 0.1 to 2mm) was measured in treatments and control plots.The litter volume in fertilized plots decreased significantly. Collembola and total mesofauna density were enhanced by the CNP addition. Ants responded differentially according to their trophic group: despite increased prey availability, predatory species in general and collembolan hunters in particular were negatively affected by both treatments. Other ant trophic group densities did not change. By contrast, the density of Dermaptera increased with the treatments. A complementary isotopic approach allowed us to trace carbon fluxes through the food web.Our results suggest that the nutrient input enhanced the litter decomposition rate, leading to reduction of habitat size. They also suggest that predatory ants in tropical leaf-litter food webs are limited by habitat size rather than by prey availability, and that these ants are more affected by habitat loss than their prey, other ant trophic groups and other macrofauna taxa. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The release of nitrogen and phosphorus from leaf litter of six representative species, Cunninghamia lanceolata, Pinus massoniana, Schima superba, Cinnamanun camphora, Cyclobalanopsis glauca and Castanopsis eyeri, was investigated with litterbag method under ambient and reduced UV-B radiation (22.1% below ambient) treatments in subtropical region. The results showed that, the N dynamics exhibited three patterns: immobilization, mineralization-immobilization and mineralization-immobilization-mineralization. P dynamics also exhibited three different patterns: mineralization, immobilization-mineralization-immobilization and no large change. Compared with ambient treatment, the reduced treatment significantly delayed the N release from C. eyeri and P release from both C. glauca and C. eyeri (P<0.05), but significantly stimulated P release from C. camphora (P<0.05). The initial N contents and C:N ratios can not account for the N dynamics during leaf litter decomposition. The C:P ratios can partly explain the P dynamics during decomposition. The more works need to be done to better understand the role of UV-B radiation in the forest ecosystem in humid subtropical China under global environment change.},

abstract={Leaf litter decomposition studied in three monoculture tree-plantations and a degraded forest at Puducherry on the Coromandel Coast (India) covering different seasons, showed significant positive correlation between the decomposition rate and rainfall across the land-uses and the forest. The decomposition constants and the half-life periods illustrated a higher decomposition rate in the forest (k=3.050 yr -1) followed by that of Acacia plantation (k=2.368 yr -1) while these were lower in Eucalyptus plantation (k= 1.699 yr -1). Cluster analysis (Bray-Curtis similarity index) of monthly decomposition rates depicted a dendrogram joining the first pair of teak and Eucalyptus plantations and the other pair of degraded forest and Acacia plantation; both pairs unified at a distance of 61%. The nitrogen (N) concentration in the decomposed leaf litter increased gradually while the C/N ratios showed a constant fall in the forest and Acacia plantation. Phosphorus, potassium and magnesium concentrations varied in the decomposed litter while calcium was meager across the plantations and the forest. © Society for Tropical Ecology.},

abstract={We compared the influence of invasion by an alien invasive species (Spartina alterniflora, smooth cordgrass) and a native aggressive species (Phragmites australis, common reed) as they have expanded into the native Cyperus malaccensis (shichito matgrass)-dominated wetland ecosystem in the Min River estuary of southeast China. S. alterniflora is a perennial grass native to North America, which has spread rapidly along the southeast coast of China since its introduction in 1979. Our study compared the above and belowground biomass, net primary production, litter decomposition, plant nutrient stocks and soil organic carbon storage of the grasses in three ecosystems: (1) the native ecosystem dominated by C. malaccensis; (2) ecosystems previously dominated by C. malaccensis but presently replaced by P. australis; and (3) ecosystems previously dominated by C. malaccensis but presently replaced by S. alterniflora. Our results demonstrate that the recent invasion (3 years) of the exotic invasive species S. alterniflora has already significantly increased live aboveground biomass and aboveground plant nutrient stocks. However, there was no significant difference in these variables between native aggressive species P. australis and native C. malaccensis. The majority of belowground root Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stocks of the three plant species were all distributed in the upper surface layer and there was a decrease with soil depth. There was little difference in litter decomposition rates among the three grass species; they were ranked in the following order: C. malaccensis>S. alterniflora>P. australis. Litter element concentration showed similar patterns for the three species. However, important differences were found between N and P; the litter N concentrations in each of the three species were greater at the end of the 280 days decomposition than at the start, but P concentrations followed a fluctuating pattern during the decomposition period. Soil organic carbon stocks (0-50 cm) under S. alterniflora, P. australis and C. malaccensis stands were statistically indistinguishable, which may be due to the invasion of S. alterniflora having been a relatively recent phenomenon. Thus, recent invasion of the exotic species S. alterniflora has already altered the nutrient cycle of C. malaccensis in the ecosystem in the Min River estuary. © 2011.},

abstract={Tropical rain forests play a dominant role in global biosphere-atmosphere CO 2 exchange. Although climate and nutrient availability regulate net primary production (NPP) and decomposition in all terrestrial ecosystems, the nature and extent of such controls in tropical forests remain poorly resolved. We conducted a meta-analysis of carbon-nutrient-climate relationships in 113 sites across the tropical forest biome. Our analyses showed that mean annual temperature was the strongest predictor of aboveground NPP (ANPP) across all tropical forests, but this relationship was driven by distinct temperature differences between upland and lowland forests. Within lowland forests (&lt;1000m), a regression tree analysis revealed that foliar and soil-based measurements of phosphorus (P) were the only variables that explained a significant proportion of the variation in ANPP, although the relationships were weak. However, foliar P, foliar nitrogen (N), litter decomposition rate (k), soil N and soil respiration were all directly related with total surface (0-10cm) soil P concentrations. Our analysis provides some evidence that P availability regulates NPP and other ecosystem processes in lowland tropical forests, but more importantly, underscores the need for a series of large-scale nutrient manipulations - especially in lowland forests - to elucidate the most important nutrient interactions and controls. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={While a large number of studies have investigated the effects of macronutrients such as nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) on litter decomposition, recent studies suggest that micronutrients including zinc (Zn) may also limit decomposition rates. Our goal was to compare the effects of nutrient addition on decomposition of two leaf litter types from tropical dry forest trees in a short-term laboratory microcosm experiment. Single nutrients (N, P, Zn, potassium, magnesium, and nickel) were applied to leaf litter in solution at low or high concentrations (to mimic in situ availability or to alleviate nutrient limitation, respectively), and decomposition was assessed as final mass remaining and carbon dioxide mineralization. Both mass remaining and CO2 mineralization were affected by nutrient identity and concentration, and these effects varied by species. In general, P and Zn addition increased decomposition, Mg and N inhibited it, and K and Ni had no significant effects. Future studies should consider the interactions between decomposition processes, decomposer communities, and a wider range of macro- and micronutrients. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Decomposition is a key ecosystem process that determines nutrient and carbon cycling. Individual leaf and litter characteristics are good predictors of decomposition rates within biomes worldwide, but knowledge of which traits are the best predictors for tropical species remains scarce. Also, the effect of a species' position on the leaf economics spectrum (LES) and regeneration light requirements on decomposition rate are, until now, unknown. In addition, land use change is the most immediate and widespread global change driver, with potentially significant consequences for decomposition. Here we evaluate 14 leaf and litter traits, and litter decomposition rates of 23 plant species from three different land use types (mature forest, secondary forest and agricultural field) in the moist tropics of lowland Bolivia. Leaf and litter traits were closely associated and showed, in line with the LES, a slow-fast continuum ranging from species with tough, well-protected leaves (high leaf density, leaf dry matter content, force to punch and litter C:N ratio) to species with cheap, productive leaves [high specific leaf area (SLA) and nutrient concentrations in leaves and litter]. Fresh green leaf traits were better predictors of decomposition rate than litter traits, and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) was a better predictor of decomposition than leaf phosphorus concentration, despite the widely held belief that tropical forests are P-limited. Multiple regression analysis showed that LNC, SLA and chlorophyll content per unit leaf area had positive effects on decomposition, explaining together 65-69% of the variation. Species position on the LES and regeneration light requirements were also positively related to decomposition. Plant communities from agricultural fields had significantly higher LNC and SLA than communities from mature forest and secondary forest. Species from agricultural fields had higher average decomposition rates than species from other ecosystems and tended to be at the fast end of the LES. 7.Both individual traits of living leaves and species' position on the LES persist in litter, so that leaves lead influential afterlifes, affecting decomposition, nutrient and carbon cycling. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={We investigated litter chemistry, and patterns of mass loss and nutrient release from leaf and sheath litter of three priority cultivated bamboo species, Bambusa cacharensis, B. vulgaris and B. balcooa, to understand litter decomposition. The study was conducted in a homegarden of Dargakona village in district Cachar, Assam, in northeast India. Leaf litter had higher concentrations of N, P and K than sheath litter, whereas sheath litter had higher carbon, ash free mass and cellulose. Percent weight loss decreased exponentially with time. Sheath litter had slower rates of mass loss than leaf litter. The pattern of N release was biphasic, P concentration exhibited an initial accumulation phase, and release of K occurred at all the stages of decomposition. We discuss the ecological significance of decomposition dynamics of bamboo litter - compared with litter of other cultivated tree species - for nutrient retention in homegardens. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.},

abstract={Proper estimates of decomposition are essential for tropical forests, given their key role in the global carbon (C) cycle. However, the current paradigm for litter decomposition is insufficient to account for recent observations and may limit model predictions for highly diverse tropical ecosystems. In light of recent findings from a nutrient-poor Amazonian rainforest, we revisit the commonly held views that: litter traits are a mere legacy of live leaf traits; nitrogen (N) and lignin are the key litter traits controlling decomposition; and favourable climatic conditions result in rapid decomposition in tropical forests. Substantial interspecific variation in litter phosphorus (P) was found to be unrelated to variation in green leaves. Litter nutrients explained no variation in decomposition, which instead was controlled primarily by nonlignin litter C compounds at low concentrations with important soil fauna effects. Despite near-optimal climatic conditions, tropical litter decomposition proceeded more slowly than in a climatically less favourable temperate forest. We suggest that slow decomposition in the studied rainforest results from a syndrome of poor litter C quality beyond a simple lignin control, enforcing energy starvation of decomposers. We hypothesize that the litter trait syndrome in nutrient-poor tropical rainforests may have evolved to increase plant access to limiting nutrients via mycorrhizal associations. © The Authors (2010).

abstract={Ecological stoichiometry predicts important control of the relative abundance of the key elements carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) on trophic interactions. In a nutrient-poor Amazonian lowland rain forest of French Guiana, we tested the hypothesis that decomposers exploit stoichiometrically diverse plant litter more efficiently, resulting in faster litter decomposition compared to litter with a uniform stoichiometry.2. In a field experiment in the presence or absence of soil macrofauna, we measured litter mass loss, and N and P dynamics from all possible combinations of leaf litter from four common tree species which were distinctly separated along a C:N and along a N:P gradient.3. Mean litter mass remaining after 204 days of field exposure varied between 25.2% and 71.3% among litter treatments. Fauna increased litter mass loss by 18%, N loss by 21% and P loss by 14%. Litter species richness had no effect on litter mass loss or nutrient dynamics. In contrast, litter mass and nutrient losses increased with increasing stoichiometric dissimilarity of litter mixtures in presence of fauna, suggesting faster decomposition of a stoichiometrically more heterogeneous litter.4. However, the effect of stoichiometric dissimilarity was smaller than the strong C quality related litter composition effect and disappeared in the absence of fauna. Increasing proportions of litter that is relatively rich in accessible C compounds (non-structural carbohydrates, phenolics) and relatively poor in recalcitrant C (condensed tannins, lignin), correlated best with litter mass loss irrespective of fauna presence. No correlation was found for any of the nutrient related litter quality parameters and decomposition.5.Synthesis. Our results suggest that Amazonian decomposer communities studied here are primarily limited by energy, and only secondarily by litter stoichiometry. Tropical tree species might thus influence decomposers and detritivores by the production of litter of specific C quality with potentially important feedback effects on ecosystem nutrient dynamics and availability. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={The rain forest canopy hosts a large percentage of the world's plant biodiversity, which is maintained, in large part, by internal nutrient cycling. This is the first study to examine the effects of site (canopy, forest floor) and tree species (Dipteryx panamensis, Lecythis ampla, Hyeronima alchorneoides) on decay rates of a common substrate and in situ leaf litter in a tropical forest in Costa Rica. Decay rates were slower for both substrates within the canopy than on the forest floor. The slower rate of mass loss of the common substrate in the canopy was due to differences in microclimate between sites. Canopy litter decay rates were negatively correlated with litter lignin:P ratios, while forest floor decay rates were negatively correlated with lignin concentrations, indicating that the control of litter decay rates in the canopy is P availability while that of the forest floor is carbon quality. The slower cycling rates within the canopy are consistent with lower foliar nutrient concentrations of epiphytes compared with forest floor-rooted plants. Litter decay rates, but not common substrate decay rates, varied among tree species. The lack of variation in common substrate decay among tree species eliminated microclimatic variation as a possible cause for differences in litter decay and points to variation in litter quality, nutrient availability and decomposer community of tree species as the causal factors. The host tree contribution to canopy nutrient cycling via litter quality and inputs may influence the quality and quantity of canopy soil resources. © 2009 The Author(s).

abstract={The mineralization of nitrogen and phosphorus from plant residues provides an important input of inorganic nutrients to the soil, which can be taken up by plants. The dynamics of nutrient mineralization or immobilization during decomposition are controlled by different biological and physical factors. Decomposers sequester carbon and nutrients from organic substrates and exchange inorganic nutrients with the environment to maintain their stoichiometric balance. Additionally, physical losses of organic compounds from leaching and other processes may alter the nutrient content of litter. In this work, we extend a stoichiometric model of litter nitrogen mineralization to include (1) phosphorus mineralization, (2) physical losses of organic nutrients, and (3) chemical heterogeneity of litter substrates The enhanced model provides analytical mineralization curves for nitrogen and phosphorus as well as critical litter carbon : nutrient ratios (the carbon : nutrient ratios below which net nutrient release occurs) as a function of the elemental composition of the decomposers, their carbon-use efficiency, and the rate of physical loss of organic compounds. The model is used to infer the critical litter carbon : nutrient ratios from observed nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics in about 2600 litterbag samplings from 21 decomposition data sets spanning artic to tropical ecosystems. At the beginning of decomposition, nitrogen and phosphorus tend to be immobilized in boreal and temperate climates (i.e., both C:N and C:P critical ratios are lower than the initial ratios), while in tropical areas nitrogen is generally released and phosphorus may be either immobilized or released, regardless of the typically low phosphorus concentrations. The critical carbon : nutrient ratios we observed were found to increase with initial litter carbon : nutrient ratios, indicating that decomposers adapt to low-nutrient conditions by reducing their carbon-use efficiency. This stoichiometric control on nutrient dynamics appears ubiquitous across climatic regions and ecosystems, although other biological and physical processes also play important roles in litter decomposition. In tropical humid conditions, we found high critical C:P ratios likely due to high leaching and low decomposer phosphorus concentrations. In general, the compound effects of stoichiometric constraints and physical losses explain most of the variability in critical carbon : nutrient ratios and dynamics of nutrient immobilization and release at the global scale. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={This study investigates whether it is possible to simplify the complex influence of numerous species on leaf litter decomposition in a diverse tropical forest using functional classifications to predict litter quality, decomposition rate, and nutrient dynamics during decomposition, over a 2-yr period. Thirty-three lowland tropical forest plant species from contrasting growth forms (canopy trees, pioneer trees, lianas, palms, herbs) were studied. Twelve of 18 indices of litter quality varied significantly among growth forms, with canopy trees and palms showing lower litter quality than pioneer trees and herbs. Canopy leaves decomposed more slowly than understory leaves. Decomposition rate and mass loss trended greater (P<0.1) in herbs and pioneer trees compared with other growth forms. There were no significant differences between monocots and dicots, and no phylogenetic signal for decomposition was observed. Significant correlations between continuous litter quality variables and decomposition rate were observed with correlation coefficients up to 0.72. Litter lignin:Mg, P concentration, and lignin:K, were the litter quality variables most related to decomposition rate. All elements showed significant negative correlations between initial litter concentration and percent remaining, but many elements showed significant correlation between percent element remaining and initial concentrations of other elements, indicating a stoichiometric balance between these elements during decomposition. The results show that although classification by growth form and canopy position are helpful for considering the ecosystem implications of changing community composition, litter quality traits provide additional predictive power for estimating the effects of species change on decomposition. © 2009 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract={Background. The isotopic composition of generalist consumers may be expected to vary in space as a consequence of spatial heterogeneity in isotope ratios, the abundance of resources, and competition. We aim to account for the spatial variation in the carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition of a generalized predatory species across a 500 ha. tropical rain forest landscape. We test competing models to account for relative influence of resources and competitors to the carbon and nitrogen isotopic enrichment of gypsy ants (Aphaenogaster araneoides), taking into account site-specific differences in baseline isotope ratios. Results. We found that 75% of the variance in the fraction of 15N in the tissue of A. araneoides was accounted by one environmental parameter, the concentration of soil phosphorus. After taking into account landscape-scale variation in baseline resources, the most parsimonious model indicated that colony growth and leaf litter biomass accounted for nearly all of the variance in the 15N discrimination factor, whereas the 13C discrimination factor was most parsimoniously associated with colony size and the rate of leaf litter decomposition. There was no indication that competitor density or diversity accounted for spatial differences in the isotopic composition of gypsy ants. Conclusion. Across a 500 ha. landscape, soil phosphorus accounted for spatial variation in baseline nitrogen isotope ratios. The 15N discrimination factor of a higher order consumer in this food web was structured by bottom-up influences - the quantity and decomposition rate of leaf litter. Stable isotope studies on the trophic biology of consumers may benefit from explicit spatial design to account for edaphic properties that alter the baseline at fine spatial grains. © 2009 McGlynn et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Tropical forests play a substantial role in the global carbon (C) cycle and are projected to experience significant changes in climate, highlighting the importance of understanding the factors that control organic matter decomposition in this biome. in the tropics, high temperature and rainfall lead to some of the highest rates of litter decomposition on earth, and given the near-optimal abiotic conditions, litter quality likely exerts disproportionate control over litter decomposition. Yet interactions between litter quality and abiotic variables, most notably precipitation, remain poorly resolved, especially for the wetter end of the tropical forest biome. We assessed the importance of variation in litter chemistry and precipitation in a lowland tropical rain forest in southwest Costa Rica that receives >5000 mm of precipitation per year, using litter from 11 different canopy tree species in conjunction with a throughfall manipulation experiment. In general, despite the exceptionally high rainfall in this forest, simulated throughfall reductions consistently suppressed rates of litter decomposition. Overall, variation between species was greater than that induced by manipulating throughfall and was best explained by initial litter solubility and lignin:P ratios. Collectively, these results support a model of litter decomposition in which mass loss rates are positively correlated with rainfall up to very high rates of mean annual precipitation and highlight the importance of phosphorus availability in controlling microbial processes in many lowland tropical forests. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={The litters of seven tree species representing the dominant plant species in three main successional stages in subtropical China, i. e., Pinus massoniana in early successional forests, Schima superba and Cinnamanun camphora in transitional forests, and Castanopsis eyeri, Cyclobalanopsis gracilis, Cyclobalanopsis glauca, and Michelia chapensis in late successional forests, were collected, and their decomposition rates were measured with litterbags. The results showed that M. chapensis and C. gracilis had the highest litter decomposition rate (k = 1. 12 and 0. 89, respectively), followed by C. camphora and S. superba (k =0. 61 and 0. 55, respectively), and P. massoniana (k=0.51), indicating that there was a trend of litter decomposition rate being increased with succession stage. Litter decomposition rate had significant correlations with the litter ' s initial P, N, and lignin contents, lignin/N ratio (P < 0. 01), and C/N ratio (P < 0. 05), suggesting that the initial P, N, and lignin contents and lignin/N ratio of leaf litter could be the good indictors of litter decomposition rate.},

abstract={The differential accumulation or loss of carbon and nutrients during decomposition can promote differentiation of wetland ecosystems, and contribute to landscape-scale heterogeneity. Tree islands are important ecosystems because they increase ecological heterogeneity in the Everglades landscape and in many tropical landscapes. Only slight differences in elevation due to peat accumulation allow the differentiation of these systems from the adjacent marsh. Hydrologic restoration of the Everglades landscape is currently underway, and increased nutrient supply that could occur with reintroduction of freshwater flow may alter these differentiation processes. In this study, we established a landscape-scale, ecosystem-level experiment to examine litter decomposition responses to increased freshwater flow in nine tree islands and adjacent marsh sites in the southern Everglades. We utilized a standard litterbag technique to quantify changes in mass loss, decay rates, and phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) dynamics of a common litter type, cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco L.) leaf litter over 64 weeks. Average C. icaco leaf degradation rates in tree islands were among the lowest reported for wetland ecosystems (0.23 ± 0.03 yr-1). We found lower mass loss and decay rates but higher absolute mass C, N, and P in tree islands as compared to marsh ecosystems after 64 weeks. With increased freshwater flow, we found generally greater mass loss and significantly higher P concentrations in decomposing leaf litter of tree island and marsh sites. Overall, litter accumulated N and P when decomposing in tree islands, and released P when decomposing in the marsh. However, under conditions of increased freshwater flow, tree islands accumulated more P while the marsh accumulated P rather than mineralizing P. In tree islands, water level explained significant variation in P concentration and N:P molar ratio in leaf tissue. Absolute P mass increased strongly with total P load in tree islands (r 2 = 0.81). In the marsh, we found strong, positive relationships with flow rate. Simultaneous C and P accumulation in tree island and mineralization in adjacent marsh ecosystems via leaf litter decomposition promotes landscape differentiation in this oligotrophic Everglades wetland. However, results of this study suggest that variation in flow rates, water levels and TP loads can shift differential P accumulation and loss leading to unidirectional processes among heterogeneous wetland ecosystems. Under sustained high P loading that could occur with increased freshwater flow, tree islands may shift to litter mineralization, further degrading landscape heterogeneity in this system, and signaling an altered ecosystem state. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Soil processes are essential in enabling forest regeneration in disturbed landscapes. Little is known about whether litterfall from dominating pioneer species in secondary rain forest is functionally equivalent to that of mixed rain-forest litter in terms of contribution to soil processes. This study used the litterbag technique to quantify the decomposition and nutrient dynamics of leaf litter characteristic of three wet tropical forest communities in the Paluma Range National Park, Queensland, Australia over 511 d. These were: undisturbed primary rain forest (mixed rain-forest species), selectively logged secondary rain forest (pioneer Alphitonia petriei) and tall open eucalypt forest (Eucalyptus grandis). Mass loss, total N, total P, K, Ca and Mg dynamics of the decaying leaves were determined, and different mathematical models were used to explain the mass loss data. Rainfall and temperature data were also collected from each site. The leaves of A. petriei and E. grandis both decomposed significantly slower in situ than the mixed rain-forest species (39%, 38% and 29% ash-free dry mass remaining respectively). Nitrogen and phosphorus were immobilized, with 182% N and 134% P remaining in E. grandis, 127% N and 132% P remaining in A. petriei and 168% N and 121% P remaining in the mixed rain-forest species. The initial lignin:P ratio and initial lignin:N ratio exerted significant controls on decomposition rates. The exceptionally slow decomposition of the pioneer species is likely to limit soil processes at disturbed tropical rain-forest sites in Australia. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2008.},

abstract={1. Some invasive alien plants accelerate nutrient turnover in the ecosystem because the litter they produce has a high specific leaf area (SLA), high concentrations of nutrients and low concentrations of lignin and polyphenolics, and therefore decomposes rapidly. These litter properties are typical of plants from nutrient-rich but not nutrient-poor ecosystems, and we therefore hypothesize that species that successfully invade nutrient-poor ecosystems might not exhibit them. We tested our hypothesis in a nutrient-poor tropical forest on a granitic island in the Seychelles. 2. Leaf litter properties and annual decomposition rates of six native and six invasive woody species were compared in a field experiment. Each species group included two pioneer, two understorey and two canopy species. We also compared soil fertility under trees of Cinnamomum verum (dominant alien canopy tree), Falcataria moluccana (alien pioneer N-fixing tree) and Northea hornei (dominant native canopy tree), measuring total nutrient concentrations and nutrient absorption by ion exchange resins. 3. Within the ecological groups of pioneer and canopy species, litter of invasive species had higher mean values of SLA (120% higher) and leaf N concentration (80% higher), and litter decomposition was 40%-80% faster (rate k) than for native species; however, there were no such differences in the group of understorey species. Soils sampled under the three tree species differed little in nutrient concentrations. 4. The results indicate that even on the very nutrient-poor soils of the granitic Seychelles, some pioneer invasive species produce more decomposable litter and therefore have the potential to alter rates of nutrient cycling. However, the small differences in soil fertility beneath native and invasive trees suggest that impacts of invasive species on nutrient cycling are more complex and less predictable in nutrient-poor ecosystems, where several nutrients may be co-limiting, and native and alien species coexist. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={Rates of weight loss and nutrient (N and P) release patterns were studied in the leaf litter of the dominant tree species (Ailanthus grandis, Altingia excelsa, Castanopsis indica, Duabanga sonneriatioides, Dysoxylum binectariferum, Mesua ferrea, Shorea assamica, Taluma hodgsonii, Terminalia myriocarpa and Vatica lancefolia) of a tropical wet evergreen forest of northeast India. Nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization rate and decay pattern varied significantly from species to species. In general, the decay pattern, characterized by using a composite polynomial regression equation, exhibited three distinct phases of decay during litter decomposition-an initial slow decay phase (0.063% weight loss day-1), followed by a rapid decay phase (0.494% weight loss day-1) and a final slow decay phase (0.136% weight loss day-1). The initial chemical composition of the litter affected decomposition rates and patterns. Species like D. sonneriatoides, D. binectariferum, and T. hodgsonii with higher N and P content, lower carbon and lignin content, and lower C:N ratio and lignin:N ratio exhibited relatively faster decomposition rates than the other species, for example M. ferrea, C. indica and A. grandis. A slow decay rate was recorded for species such as M. ferrea, C. indica, and A. grandis. The initial N and P content of litter showed significant positive correlations with decay rates. Carbon and lignin content, lignin:N, and C:N showed significant negative correlations with decay rates. Soil total N and P, and rainfall, soil temperature, and soil moisture had positive correlations with decay rates. The rapid decomposition rates observed in comparison with other different forest litter decay rates confirm that tropical wet evergreen forest species are characterized by faster decomposition rates, indicating a faster rate of organic matter turnover and rapid nutrient cycling. © 2007 The Japanese Forest Society and Springer.},

abstract={To explore the importance of 12 elements in litter production and decomposition, we fertilized 36 1600 m2-plots with combinations of N, P, K, or micronutrients (i.e. B, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, S, Zn) for 6 years in a lowland Panamanian forest. The 90% of litter falling as leaves and twigs failed to increase with fertilization, but reproductive litter (fruits and flowers) increased by 43% with N. K enhanced cellulose decomposition; one or more micronutrients enhanced leaf-litter decomposition; P enhanced both. Our results suggest tropical forests are a non-Liebig world of multiple nutrient limitations, with at least four elements shaping rates of litterfall and decomposition. Multiple metallomic enzymes and cofactors likely create gradients in the break down of leaf litter. Selection favours individuals that make more propagules, and even in an N-rich forest, N is a non-substitutable resource for reproduction. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Distribution, dynamics and mass budget of phosphorus and nitrogen in a red mangrove forest were studied in the Potengi mangrove forest in northern Brazil (lat. 5°42′ and 5°53′ S, long. 35°5′ and 35°25′ W). Tidal hydrology, net primary productivity, leaf litter decomposition rate and standing stock of leaf litter in a red mangrove forest were measured. The results showed that the main reservoir for total P and total N was the sediment with 309 kg ha-1 and 4619 kg ha-1 (77% and 95% of the total P and N content in the mangrove forest), respectively, for the two elements. Total P and total N in Rhizophora mangle trees accounted for 145 ± 14 kg ha-1 and 216 ± 23 kg ha-1 (23% and 5% of the total P and N in the mangrove forest). The estimated average export rates for P and N through leaf litter are 0.5 kg ha-1 yr-1 and 1.6 kg ha-1 yr-1 respectively. Our measurements support previous results in concluding that mangrove forests efficiently retain P and N. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Leaf-litter decomposition is a major component of carbon and nutrient dynamics in tropical forest ecosystems, and moisture availability is widely considered to be a major influence on decomposition rates. Here, we report the results of a study of leaf-litter decomposition of five tree species in response to dry-season irrigation in a tropical forest regrowth stand in the Brazilian Amazon; three experiments differing in the timing of installation and duration allowed for an improved resolution of irrigation effects on decomposition. We hypothesized that decomposition rates would be faster under higher moisture availability in the wet season and during dry-season irrigation periods in the treatment plots, and that decomposition rates would be faster for species with higher quality leaves, independent of treatment. The rates of decomposition (k) were up to 2.4 times higher in irrigated plots than in control plots. The highest k values were shown by Annona paludosa (0.97 to 1.26/yr) while Ocotea guianensis (0.73 to 0.85/yr) had the lowest values; intermediate rates were found for Lacistema pubescens (0.91 to 1.02/yr) and Vismia guianensis (0.91 to 1.08/yr). These four tree species differed significantly in leaf-litter quality parameters (nitrogen, phosphorus, lignin, and cellulose concentrations, as well as lignin:nitrogen and carbon:nitrogen ratios), but differences in decomposition rates among tree species were not strictly correlated with leaf-litter quality. Overall, our results show that dry-season moisture deficits limit decomposition in Amazonian forest regrowth. © 2007 The Author(s).},

abstract={I investigated the relationship between leaf physiological traits and decomposition of leaf litter for 35 plant species of contrasting growth forms from a lowland tropical forest in Panama to determine whether leaf traits could be used to predict decomposition. Decomposition rate (k) was correlated with specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) across all species. Photosynthetic rate per unit mass (Amass) was not correlated with k, but structural equation modeling showed support for a causal model with significant indirect effects of Amass on k through SLA, N, and P, but not K. The results indicate that the decomposability of leaf tissue in this tropical forest is related to a global spectrum of leaf economics that varies from thin, easily decomposable leaves with high nutrient concentrations and high photosynthetic rates to thick, relatively recalcitrant leaves with greater physical toughness and defenses and low photosynthetic rates. If this pattern is robust across biomes, then selection for suites of traits that maximize photosynthetic carbon gain over the lifetime of the leaf may be used to predict the effects of plant species on leaf litter decomposition, thus placing the ecosystem process of decomposition in an evolutionary context. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Few studies have been conducted to investigate ecological roles of litter amphibians in forest ecosystems. In this study, ten field enclosures (3 m x 2 m x 0.4 m) were used to evaluate effects of the toad Bufo bankorensis on the abundance of litter invertebrates (microbivores, fragmenters and predatory arthropods) and litter decomposition rates in a subtropical forest of southern Taiwan. Litterbags collected from toad and control (toad-excluded) enclosures were analysed for the communities and abundances of litter invertebrates and decay loss during this decomposition study from September to December 2001. The presence of B. bankorensis significantly changed phosphorus concentrations in the litter, but not the densities of litter invertebrates (microbivores, fragmenters and predatory arthropods) or rates of litter decomposition. These results were not consistent with previous studies, which have shown that Plethodon cenereus in a temperate forest of north-east USA and Eleutherodactylus coqui in a tropical rain forest of Puerto Rico significantly changed decomposition rates. We suggest that ecological roles of ground-dwelling amphibians may be species-specific and vary with different terrestrial ecosystems. Copyright © 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={N cycling in tropical dry forests is driven by rainfall seasonality but the mechanisms involved are not well understood. We studied the seasonal variation in N dynamics and microbial biomass in the surface litter of a tropical dry forest ecosystem in Mexico over a 2-year period. Litter was collected at 4 different times of the year to determine changes in total, soluble, and microbial C and N concentrations. Additionally, litter from each sampling date was incubated under laboratory conditions to determine potential C mineralization rate, net N mineralization, net C and N microbial immobilization, and net nitrification. Litter C concentrations were highest in the early-dry season and lowest in the rainy season, while the seasonal changes in N concentrations varied between years. Litter P was higher in the rainy than in the early-dry season. Water-soluble organic C (WSOC) and water-soluble N concentrations were highest during the early- and late-dry seasons and represented up to 4.1 and 5.9% of the total C and N, respectively. NH 4 + and NO 3 - showed different seasonal and annual variations. They represented an average 23% of soluble N. Microbial C was generally higher in the dry than in the wet seasons, while microbial N was lowest in the late-dry and highest in the early-rainy seasons. Incubations showed that lowest potential C mineralization rates and C and N microbial immobilization occurred in rainy season litter, and were positively correlated to WSOC. Net nitrification was highest in rainy season litter. Our results showed that the seasonal pattern in N dynamics was influenced by rainfall seasonality and labile C availability, and not by microbial biomass. We propose a conceptual model to hypothesize how N dynamics in the litter layer of the Chamela tropical dry forest respond to the seasonal variation in rainfall. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Differences in forest productivity due to climate change may result in permanently altered levels of litterfall and litter on the forest floor. Using experimental litter removal and litter addition treatments, we investigated the effects of increased and decreased litterfall on early-stage litter decomposition and the abundance of meso-arthropods in a moist tropical forest. Litterbags containing freshly fallen leaves of Cecropia insignis (above and below the litter on the forest floor, and with and without fungicide) and Simarouba amara, or untreated birch wood (Betula sp.) were placed in either (1) plots where all litterfall was removed monthly (L-); (2) plots where litterfall was doubled monthly (L+), or (3) control plots (CT). Litter removal significantly slowed decomposition of both species and reduced the abundance of meso-arthropods on Simarouba litter. The fungicide treatment did not reduce apparent mass loss of Cecropia leaves. The litter addition treatment accelerated the decay of birch wood, probably because of increased nutrient availability from the extra litter; but there was no change in leaf-litter decomposition or meso-arthropod abundance in the L+ treatment. After 68 days, the concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium in partially decomposed Cecropia litter were higher in the L+ treatment and lower in the L- treatment. The accumulation of phosphorus and nitrogen was greater in the litter in L+ plots and lower in the L- plots while the release of potassium and magnesium from decomposing litter was lower in the L+ treatment and greater in the L- plots. Thus, differences in the quantity of litterfall affect decomposition with consequences for carbon and nutrient storage and cycling. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

(Cecropiaceae) a pioneer tree species, and Cyathea arborea (L.) Sm. (Cyatheaceae) a pioneer tree fern. I compared leaf litter decomposition over one year and the initial and 1-yr chemistry for both species. Initial litter chemistry differed between the two species, as Cecropia had slightly higher nitrogen (9.2 mg/g) than Cyathea (8.2 mg/g) and higher lignin (28.6%) than Cyathea (26.0%), but water-soluble carbon and nonpolar extractable carbon (fats and oils, waxes, chlorophylls) were higher in Cyathea than Cecropia. Total carbon, acid-soluble carbon, total phosphorus, and pH did not differ significantly between leaf litter species. Across all five landslides, Cyathea (k= 0.93 ± 0.06) leaves decomposed significantly faster than Cecropia (k= 0.68 ± 0.06). The differences in these species leaf litter decomposition rates and chemical composition could potentially influence organic matter dynamics and nutrient cycling rates in these early successional systems. © 2006 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract={The role of phytophagous insects in ecosystem nutrient cycling remains poorly understood. By altering the flow of litterfall nutrients from the canopy to the forest floor, herbivores may influence key ecosystem processes. We manipulated levels of herbivory in a lower montane tropical rainforest of Puerto Rico using the common herbivore, Lamponius portoricensis (Phasmatidea), on a prevalent understory plant, Piper glabrescens (Piperaceae), and measured the effects on nutrient input to the forest floor and on rates of litter decomposition. Four treatment levels of herbivory generated a full range of leaf area removal, from plants experiencing no herbivory to plants that were completely defoliated (&gt;4,000 cm2 leaf area removed during the 76-day study duration). A significant (P&lt;0.05) positive regression was found between all measures of herbivory (total leaf area removed, greenfall production, and frass-related inputs) and the concentration of NO 3 - in ion exchange resin bags located in the litter layer. No significant relationship was found between any of the herbivory components and resin bag concentrations of NH 4 + or PO 4 - . Rates of litter decay were significantly affected by frass-related herbivore inputs. A marginally significant negative relationship was also found between the litter mass remaining at 47 days and total leaf area removed. This study demonstrated a modest, but direct relationship between herbivory and both litter decomposition and NO 3 - transfer to the forest floor. These results suggest that insect herbivores can influence forest floor nutrient dynamics and thus merit further consideration in discussions on ecosystem nutrient dynamics. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract={We investigated the decomposability of soil organic matter (SOM) along a chronosequence of rainforest sites in Hawaii that form a natural fertility gradient and at two long-term fertilization experiments. To estimate turnover times and pool sizes of organic matter, we used two independent methods: (1) long-term incubations and (2) a three-box soil model constrained by radiocarbon measurements. Turnover times of slow-pool SOM (the intermediate pool between active and passive pools) calculated from incubations ranged from 6 to 20 y in the O horizon and were roughly half as fast in the A horizon. The radiocarbon-based model yielded a similar pattern but slower turnover times. The calculation of the 14C turnover times is sensitive to the lag time between photosynthesis and incorporation of organic C into SOM in a given horizon. By either method, turnover times at the different sites varied two- or threefold in soils with the same climate and vegetation community. Turnover times were fastest at the sites of highest soil fertility and were correlated with litter decay rates and primary productivity. However, experimental fertilization at the two least-fertile sites had only a small and inconsistent effect on turnover, with N slowing turnover and P slightly speeding it at one site. These results support studies of litter decomposition in suggesting that while plant productivity can respond rapidly to nutrient additions, decomposition may respond much more slowly to added nutrients. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract={Understanding secondary successional processes in Amazonian terrestrial ecosystems is becoming increasingly important as continued deforestation expands the area that has become secondary forest, or at least has been through a recent phase of secondary forest growth. Most Amazonian soils are highly weathered and relatively nutrient poor, but the role of nutrients as a factor determining successional processes is unclear. Soils testing and chronosequence studies have yielded equivocal results regarding the possible role of nutrient limitation. The objective of this paper is to report the first two years' results of a nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization experiment in a 6-yr-old secondary forest growing on an abandoned cattle pasture on a clayey Oxisol. Growth of remnant grasses responded significantly to the N + P treatment, whereas tree biomass increased significantly following N-only and N + P treatments. The plants took up about 10% of the 50 kg P/ha of the first year's application, and recovery in soil fractions could account for the rest. The trees took up about 20% of the 100 kg N/ha of the first year's application. No changes in soil inorganic N, soil microbial biomass N, or litter decomposition rates have been observed so far, but soil faunal abundances increased in fertilized plots relative to the control in the second year of the study. A pulse of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide emissions was measured in the N-treated plots only shortly after the second year's application. Net N mineralization and net nitrification assays demonstrated strong immobilization potential, indicating that much of the N was probably retained in the large soil organic-N pool. Although P availability is low in these soils and may partially limit biomass growth, the most striking result of ' this study so far is the significant response of tree growth to N fertilization. Repeated fire and other losses of N from degraded pastures may render tree growth N limited in some young Amazonian forests. Changes in species composition and monitoring of long-term effects on biomass accumulation will be addressed as this experiment is continued.},

abstract={During succession, ecosystem development occurs; but in the long-term absence of catastrophic disturbance, a decline. phase eventually follows. We studied six long-term chronosequences, in Australia, Sweden, Alaska, Hawaii, and New Zealand; for each, the decline phase was associated with a reduction in tree basal area and an increase in the substrate nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio, indicating increasing phosphorus limitation over time. These changes were often associated with reductions in litter decomposition rates, phosphorus release from litter, and biomass and activity of decomposer microbes. Our findings suggest that the maximal biomass phase reached during succession cannot be maintained in the long-term absence of major disturbance, and that similar patterns of decline occur in forested ecosystems spanning the tropical, temperate, and boreal zones.},

abstract={We compared phosphorus (P) dynamics and plant productivity in two montane tropical rain forests (Mount Kinabalu, Borneo) that derived from similar parent materials (largely sedimentary rocks) and had similar climates but differed in terms of soil age. The younger site originated from Quaternary colluvial deposits, whereas the older site had Tertiary-age material. The older site had a distinctive spodic horizon, reduced levels of labile inorganic soil P, higher concentrations of recalcitrant organic soil P, and lower rates of net soil N mineralization. P fertilization led to soil nitrogen (N) immobilization in the P-deficient soil, indicating that soil N mineralization was limited by P at the P-deficient older site. Mean foliar nutrient concentration (on both a weight and an area basis) was similar at the two sites for all elements except P, which was lower at the older site. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) was lower at the older site than at the younger one; this difference could be explained by the reduced availability of P and N (as down-regulated by P) at the older site. The relatively ample allocation of P and N to leaves, despite the reduced availability at the P-deficient old site, was attributable to its high resorption efficiency. High resorption resulted in lower concentrations of elements in leaf litter - that is, less decomposable low-quality litter. On the other hand, the concentration of leaf litter lignin was considerably lower at the older site; this appeared to be a de facto adaptive mechanism to avoid retarding litter decomposition.},

abstract={Litter quality parameters such as nitrogen and lignin content correlate with decomposition rates at coarse scales, but fine-scale mechanisms driving litter decomposition have proven more difficult to generalize. One potentially important driver of decomposition is the activity of extracellular enzymes that catalyze the degradation of complex compounds present in litter. To address the importance of this mechanism, we collected 15 Hawaiian plant litter types and decomposed them in fertilized and control plots for up to two years. We measured litter nutrient content and carbon chemistry prior to decomposition, as well as extracellular enzyme activities, mass loss, and litter nutrient content over time. We found that water-soluble carbon content, cellobiohydrolase activities, and polyphenol oxidase activities were significantly correlated with mass loss. Enzyme activities and decomposition rate constants both varied significantly by litter type, and fertilization increased mass loss rates in five litter types. Some litter types that decayed faster under fertilization also showed time-dependent increases in carbon-degrading enzyme activities, but others decayed faster independent of enzyme changes. These results suggest that extracellular enzyme activities partially determine litter decomposition rates, but high soluble carbon content may circumvent the requirement for enzyme-catalyzed decomposition.},

abstract={Once the weathering of parent material ceases to supply significant inputs of phosphorus (P), vegetation depends largely on the decomposition of litter and soil organic matter and the associated mineralization of organic P forms to provide an adequate supply of this essential nutrient. At the same time, the decomposition of litter is often characterized by the immobilization of nutrients, suggesting that nutrient availability is a limiting factor for this process. Immobilization temporally decouples nutrient mineralization from decomposition and may play an important role in nutrient retention in low-nutrient ecosystems. In this study, we used a common substrate to study the effects of native soil P availability as well as artificially elevated P availability on litter decomposition rates in a lowland Amazonian rain forest on highly weathered soils. Although both available and total soil P pools varied almost three fold across treatments, there was no significant difference in decomposition rates among treatments. Decomposition was rapid in all treatments, with approximately 50% of the mass lost over the 11-month study period. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) remaining and C:N ratios were the most effective predictors of amount of mass remaining at each time point in all treatments. Fertilized treatments showed significant amounts of P immobilization (P < 0.001). By the final collection point, the remaining litter contained a quantity equivalent to two-thirds of the initial P and N, even though only half of the original mass remained. In these soils, immobilization of nutrients in the microbial biomass, late in the decomposition process, effectively prevents the loss of essential nutrients through leaching or occlusion in the mineral soil.},

abstract={Tropical land-use changes can have profound influence on earthworms that play important roles in regulating soil processes. Converting tropical forests to pastures often drastically increases the abundance of exotic earthworm populations such as Pontoscolex corethrurus. We initiated this study to examine the influence of exotic earthworms on the decomposition of plant leaves and roots in a tropical pasture and a wet forest of Puerto Rico. We employed two treatments: control with natural earthworm population, and earthworm reduction using an electroshocking technique. Decomposition rates of plant leaves on the ground surface and root materials within the surface mineral soil were estimated using a litterbag technique. To understand the role that exotic earthworms play in altering plant litter decomposition, we also compared soil CO2 evolution rates, soil microbial biomass, and physical and chemical soil properties between the controls and earthworm-reduced plots during a one-year period. Earthworm populations in the electroshocked enclosures were reduced by 85% and 87% as compared with pasture and forest controls by the end of the experiment. Earthworm reduction significantly decreased the annual decay rates of plant leaves but had no effects on those of plant roots in both pasture and forest sites. Although the control plots had less mass remaining on every litterbag collecting date, significant treatment effects on leaf decomposition occurred only after 240 d in both sites. The decay rates were greater when organic materials had low carbon to nitrogen or phosphorus ratios. Soil respiration was also decreased in the earthworm-reduced plots. In contrast, soil microbial biomass C was not affected by earthworm reduction. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the two treatments in soil bulk density, moisture content, pH, or temperature at either site. Our results suggest that exotic earthworms may accelerate leaf litter decomposition by elevating rates of litter consumption/digestion or microbial activity, rather than by improving soil physical/chemical conditions or altering microbial biomass.},

abstract={Litterbags were used to study the decomposition of abscissed leaves of two tree species belonging to one genus, Dillenia indica (evergreen) and Dillenia pentagyna (deciduous) in a humid tropical forest of Arunachal Pradesh, north-eastern India. Hundred per cent decomposition was observed after 150 days for D. indica and 120 days for D. pentagyna. The leaf litter decomposition of the two species showed different temporal trends; decomposition of D. indica leaf litter showed an initial lag phase, followed by a rapid decay phase and a final slow decay phase, while D. pentagyna leaf litter decomposed rapidly initially up to 60 days, but declined sharply afterwards. A composite linear equation showed a good fit for the observed decay patterns. The annual decay constant (k) was significantly higher (p < 0.01) for D. pentagyna (9.11) than for D. indica (6.15). The nutrient concentrations differed significantly between species. The mature as well as decomposing leaves had more nutrient concentrations compared with the abscissed leaves (leaf litter). The retranslocation of nitrogen before abscission was greater in D. indica, while percentage phosphorus retranslocation was similar in both species. The nutrient release patterns indicated that the N and P mineralisation of D. pentagyna leaf litter is faster compared to D. indica, as associated with their respective decay rates.},

abstract={No information is available on the decomposition and nutrient release pattern of Piper aduncum and Imperata cylindrica despite their importance in shifting cultivation systems of Papua New Guinea and other tropical regions. We conducted a litter bag study (24 weeks) on a Typic Eutropepts in the humid lowlands to assess the rate of decomposition of Piper aduncum, Imperata cylindrica and Gliricidia sepium leaves under sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). Decomposition rates of piper leaf litter were fastest followed closely by gliricidia, and both lost 50% of the leaf biomass within 10 weeks. Imperata leaf litter decomposed much slower and half-life values exceeded the period of observation. The decomposition patterns were best explained by the lignin plus polyphenol over N ratio which was lowest for piper (4.3) and highest for imperata (24.7). Gliricidia leaf litter released 79 kg N ha-1, whereas 18 kg N ha-1 was immobilised in the imperata litter. The mineralization of P was similar for the three species, but piper litter released large amounts of K. The decomposition and nutrient release patterns had significant effects on the soil. The soil contained significantly more water in the previous imperata plots at 13 weeks due to the relative slow decomposition of the leaves. Soil N levels were significantly reduced in the previous imperata plots due to immobilisation of N. Levels of exchangeable K were significantly increased in the previous piper plots due to the large addition of K. It can be concluded that piper leaf litter is a significant and easily decomposable source of K which is an important nutrient for sweet potato. Gliricidia leaf litter contained much N, whereas imperata leaf litter releases relatively little nutrients and keeps the soil more moist. Gliricidia fallow is more attractive than an imperata fallow for it improves the soil fertility and produces fuelwood as additional saleable products.},

abstract={Abstract. It is often stated that the availability of N limits the rate of growth of native forests. We discuss this hypothesis with particular reference to the mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of south-eastern Australia. The abundance of 15N in leaves and soil of mountain ash forest is in accord with data for Northern Hemisphere temperate forests and for tropical forests, and indicates that N availability is relatively high. None of the nutrient elements has limited the rate of growth of mountain ash forest regenerating after major disturbance (clear-felling and intense wild-fire). There is some evidence that P may be limiting to some ecological processes (e.g. the rate of litter decomposition). We conclude that phosphorus is more likely to be limiting than nitrogen in mountain ash forest because nitrogen cycling is conservative and continual inputs of N through biological fixation supplement this conservative N supply, and the stands never become N-deficient. The development of methodologies to determine the rate of N2-fixation in forests should be of high priority in ecological research.},

abstract={Soil-plant processes which enhance P acquisition and cycling in low-P Oxisols were investigated in a crop rotations and ley pasture systems experiment on the Colombian eastern plains. Comparison of rooting patterns indicated that, despite low available P at depth, there are important differences in root size and distribution among native savanna, introduced forage and crop species which affect their ability to acquire P from these soils. Differences in crop/forage residue decomposition and P release rates suggest that managing the interaction of residue with soil may help slow P fixation reactions. Despite these differences, soil P fractionation measurements indicate that applied P moves preferentially into labile inorganic P pools, and then only slowly via biomass production and microbes into organic P pools under both pastures and crop rotations.},

abstract={The impact of extensive livestock farming on the physical and chemical characteristics of the volcanic soils and on the nutrient status of green plant tissues of neotropical alpine grasslands (páramo) is studied. Soil and plant samples were taken over a one-year period at five sites with different agricultural (grazing and burning) management. In the undisturbed páramo ecosystem, soil moisture (50-250%) and organic matter content are high (7-27%) and decomposition (11-35% yr-1) and element concentrations are low. Low temperatures (max &lt; 10°C) and phosphorus fixation by the soil (5 mg P g-1 soil) determine the low mineralization and turn-over rates. Multivariate analysis of laboratory results indicates that the season of sampling and the agricultural practice are the most important explanatory factors for variation of soil characteristics. After long-term heavy grazing, soils have a higher bulk density and a lower moisture content. The outcome of a litterbag experiment confirms the hypothesis of higher decomposition rates at grazed sites. In the intermediate (wet-dry) season, conditions were somewhat better for plant growth but the system remained nutrient limited. Surprisingly, no relation between soil density, moisture or carbon content and concentrations of available nutrients in the soil is found. This is supported by the rather uniform nutrient concentrations in green plant tissue among the sites. It is concluded therefore that the effect of burning and grazing on páramo soils is principally restricted to physical characteristics, and that differences in chemical characteristics of the soil do not cause differences in vegetation structure between grazed, burned and undisturbed sites. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={Decomposition of litter on the forest floor and of leaves of five species. Celtis zenkeri, Cola lepidota, Desbordesia glaucescens, Ceiba pentandra and Terminalia superba in nylon mesh bags, as well as wood decay were studied in the tropical rainforest at Southern Bakundu Forest Reserve, Cameroon. The rate of loss of dry matter was fastest in Celtis zenkeri which was significantly different from the other species, while potassium was the most rapidly released element from all species with more than 50% being released in the first two months of the experiment. Nitrogen and phosphorus showed initial increases in bagged leaf litter independent of dry weight losses and while nitrogen was later released phosphorus continued to increase reaching 2–3 times the initial concentration. Decomposition constant (k) of litter on the forest floor was found to be 2.23 whereas the mean decomposition constants of the different species were as follows: Celtis zenkeri 4.18, Cola lepidota 2.18, Desbordesia glaucescens 1.60 and Ceiba pentandra 2.16 for the two experiments. Termites were found to have a very great influence on the decay of the wood of Terminalia superba with decay due to micro-organisms being negligible. © 1995, Cambridge University Press.

abstract={Rates and patterns of nitrogen mineralization from decomposing plant materials are known to be affected by initial concentrations of N, lignin and soluble polyphenols, but published results show differences in which properties correlated best with N release. We incubated soil with fresh leaves and litter from 12 species commonly used in tropical agroforestry systems, including both legumes and non-legumes, to estimate how release of mineral N was affected by chemical composition. After 16 weeks, net accumulation of mineral N in incubations ranged from 81% of initial N in fresh Sesbania sesban to net depletion equivalent to 70% of initial N in Casuarina equisetifolia litter. Fresh legume leaves generally had net N accumulation, whereas legume litter and non-legume fresh leaves and litter had net depletion. At all sampling dates, the percent of leaf N accumulated was most highly correlated with initial N concentration. Phosphorus and the ratios lignin:N and (lignin + polyphenol):N also strongly correlated with N accumulation, although these indices themselves were correlated with N. We conclude that differences among previous studies in best chemical predictors of mineralization rates arose from relatively small ranges in chemical composition of materials used. Over our wide range of materials, initial soluble polyphenols were secondary to initial N, which explained most of the variation in N accumulation or depletion. © 1994.},
